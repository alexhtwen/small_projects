Here's how to use SFTP on your Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server:

Install the OpenSSH server if it's not already installed:
Copy code
sudo apt install openssh-server
Enable and start the SSH server:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
Configure the firewall to allow SSH traffic:
Copy code
sudo ufw allow ssh
To use SFTP, you can simply connect with an SFTP client (such as FileZilla, Cyberduck, or WinSCP) using your server's IP address, your system user credentials, and the default SSH port (22).
For added security, you can also configure public key authentication, disable password authentication, and change the default SSH port. To do this, edit the SSH configuration file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Make the following changes:

To disable password authentication:
perl
Copy code
PasswordAuthentication no
To change the default SSH port (replace 'custom_port' with your desired port number):
Copy code
Port custom_port
Save and close the file, then restart the SSH server:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
Update the firewall rules if you changed the SSH port:

arduino
Copy code
sudo ufw delete allow ssh
sudo ufw allow custom_port/tcp
In summary, while vsftpd is secure compared to other FTP servers, SFTP is generally a better choice for transferring files securely, as it encrypts both data and credentials during transmission.




User
Do the clients need to install ssh or make other settings on their machines before connecting to  SFTP?

ChatGPT
Clients do not need to install an SSH server on their machines, but they do need an SFTP client to connect to the SFTP server. Many popular FTP clients, like FileZilla, Cyberduck, or WinSCP, support SFTP connections out of the box. If you're using the command line, most Unix-based systems, including Linux and macOS, have an SFTP command-line client pre-installed.

Here's how to connect to an SFTP server with different methods:

Graphical SFTP clients:
For graphical SFTP clients like FileZilla, Cyberduck, or WinSCP, simply select the SFTP protocol when creating a new connection, and provide the server's IP address or hostname, your username, password, and the SSH port (default is 22).

Command-line SFTP clients:
On Linux, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), the command-line SFTP client is usually pre-installed. To connect to an SFTP server, open a terminal and use the following command:

css
Copy code
sftp -P port_number username@server_ip_address
Replace port_number with the SSH port number (default is 22), username with your system username, and server_ip_address with the server's IP address or hostname. After entering the command, you'll be prompted for your password.

On Windows, you can use the built-in SFTP client in PowerShell (available in Windows 10 and later). To connect to an SFTP server, open a PowerShell window and use the following command:

css
Copy code
sftp -oPort=port_number username@server_ip_address
Replace port_number, username, and server_ip_address as mentioned above. After entering the command, you'll be prompted for your password.

Keep in mind that if public key authentication is enabled and password authentication is disabled on the server, you'll need to set up an SSH key pair on your client machine and share the public key with the server. The process for doing this varies depending on the client software you're using.




User
Would you mind providing a more detailed step-by-step guide to set up and configure an SFTP server on Ubuntu 22.04, including creating client accounts?

ChatGPT
Of course! Here's a detailed step-by-step guide to set up and configure an SFTP server on Ubuntu 22.04, including creating client accounts.

Update the system:
sql
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
Install the OpenSSH server:
Copy code
sudo apt install openssh-server
Enable and start the SSH server:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
Configure the firewall to allow SSH traffic:
Copy code
sudo ufw allow ssh
Create a new user account for the client:
Copy code
sudo adduser sftp_user
Replace sftp_user with the desired username. You'll be prompted to enter a password and other optional user information.

Restrict the user to their home directory:
Edit the SSH configuration file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Add the following lines at the end of the file:

perl
Copy code
Match User sftp_user
  ForceCommand internal-sftp
  ChrootDirectory %h
  AllowTcpForwarding no
  PermitTunnel no
  X11Forwarding no
Replace sftp_user with the username you created in step 5.

Save and close the file by pressing Ctrl + X, then Y, and then Enter.

Restart the SSH server to apply changes:
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
Set the correct permissions for the user's home directory:
By default, the ChrootDirectory must be owned by root and not writable by any other user or group. Change the ownership and permissions for the user's home directory:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown root:root /home/sftp_user
sudo chmod 755 /home/sftp_user
Replace sftp_user with the username you created in step 5.

Create a directory for the user to upload and download files:
bash
Copy code
sudo mkdir /home/sftp_user/files
sudo chown sftp_user:sftp_user /home/sftp_user/files
Replace sftp_user with the username you created in step 5.

Now, your SFTP server is set up and configured with a restricted client account. The client can connect to the server using an SFTP client (like FileZilla, Cyberduck, or WinSCP) or a command-line SFTP client by providing the server's IP address or hostname, their username, and password. The default SSH port is 22, but you can change it in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file if needed.

For added security, you can also configure public key authentication and disable password authentication by following the instructions in my previous response.




User
Using the steps you provided, would the SFTP server automatically start after rebooting?

ChatGPT
Yes, using the steps provided, the SFTP server will automatically start after rebooting. When you enable the SSH server using the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable ssh
You're telling the system to start the SSH server automatically when the system boots up. Since SFTP is a part of the SSH server, it will also start automatically upon rebooting.

You can check the status of the SSH server (and by extension, the SFTP server) at any time using the command:

lua
Copy code
sudo systemctl status ssh
This command will show you whether the SSH server is running, stopped, or enabled to start at boot.




User
Could I have both SFTP server and vsftpd enabled on the same machine?

ChatGPT
Yes, you can have both an SFTP server and vsftpd (FTP server) enabled on the same machine. They operate on different ports and use different protocols, so they will not conflict with each other.

By default, vsftpd listens on ports 20 and 21 for active and passive FTP connections, while the SFTP server, being part of the SSH server, listens on port 22. You can run both services simultaneously, as long as you configure them correctly and allow the appropriate ports in your firewall.

To summarize, you can follow the steps provided earlier to set up and configure both an SFTP server (using OpenSSH) and an FTP server (using vsftpd) on the same machine. Just make sure to configure the appropriate ports and firewall settings for each service.




User
> Edit the SSH configuration file:
Match User sftp_user
  ForceCommand internal-sftp
  ChrootDirectory %h
  AllowTcpForwarding no
  PermitTunnel no
  X11Forwarding no

If I have three users: rebecca, thomas, alex
Should I write:
Match User rebecca, thomas, alex
  ForceCommand internal-sftp
  ChrootDirectory %h
  ...
Or one seperate block for each user?
Match User rebecca
  ForceCommand internal-sftp
  ChrootDirectory %h
  ...

Match User thomas
  ForceCommand internal-sftp
  ChrootDirectory %h
  ...

Match User alex
  ForceCommand internal-sftp
  ChrootDirectory %h
  ...

ChatGPT
If you want to apply the same configuration for all three users, you can use a single Match User block and separate the usernames with commas:

perl
Copy code
Match User rebecca,thomas,alex
  ForceCommand internal-sftp
  ChrootDirectory %h
  AllowTcpForwarding no
  PermitTunnel no
  X11Forwarding no
Make sure not to include spaces after the commas, as the SSH daemon might interpret them as part of the username.

Using a single block like this is more concise and easier to maintain if you want the same settings to apply to all users. If you need different settings for each user, you should create separate Match User blocks for each user, as shown in your second example.




User
> Now, your SFTP server is set up and configured with a restricted client account.

Do these newly created users have access only to SFTP, or others services as well?

ChatGPT
By following the provided steps, the newly created users will have access to other services on the system, too. They will be able to log in using SSH and use any other service they have permission to access. However, by adding the ForceCommand internal-sftp line in the Match User block, their SSH sessions will be limited to SFTP only.

If you want to restrict these users exclusively to SFTP and prevent them from using other services, you can make the following changes:

Set the user's shell to /usr/sbin/nologin or /bin/false. This will disable interactive login for the user:
bash
Copy code
sudo usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin sftp_user
Replace sftp_user with the username you want to restrict.

Modify the Match User block in the SSH configuration file to allow the SFTP subsystem to accept users with the /usr/sbin/nologin or /bin/false shell:
Edit the SSH configuration file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Find the line that starts with Subsystem (it should look like Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server), and comment it out by adding a # at the beginning of the line:

shell
Copy code
# Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
Add a new line below it with the following content:

csharp
Copy code
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp
Then, in the Match User block, add the following line:

perl
Copy code
Match User sftp_user
  ForceCommand internal-sftp
  ChrootDirectory %h
  AllowTcpForwarding no
  PermitTunnel no
  X11Forwarding no
  PasswordAuthentication yes
Replace sftp_user with the username you want to restrict.

Save and close the file, and restart the SSH server to apply the changes:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
Now, the user will be restricted to SFTP access only and won't be able to use other services like SSH login, as their shell is set to /usr/sbin/nologin or /bin/false. Make sure to repeat these steps for each user you want to restrict.




User
If I would like to restrict these users to SFTP and  vsftpd (these two services only),  blocking accesses to other resources on my Ubuntu 22.04 machine, then how should I adjust the configurations?

ChatGPT
To restrict users to only SFTP and vsftpd services on your Ubuntu 22.04 machine, you can take the following steps:

Restrict users to SFTP:
Follow the instructions in my previous response to restrict the users to SFTP access by setting their shell to /usr/sbin/nologin or /bin/false and modifying the SSH configuration file.

Configure vsftpd for the users:
Install vsftpd if you haven't done so already:

Copy code
sudo apt install vsftpd
Edit the vsftpd configuration file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Ensure the following settings are enabled (uncommented) or add them if they're missing:

makefile
Copy code
listen=NO
listen_ipv6=YES
anonymous_enable=NO
local_enable=YES
write_enable=YES
local_umask=022
dirmessage_enable=YES
use_localtime=YES
xferlog_enable=YES
connect_from_port_20=YES
chroot_local_user=YES
secure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty
pam_service_name=vsftpd
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
ssl_enable=YES
allow_anon_ssl=NO
force_local_data_ssl=YES
force_local_logins_ssl=YES
ssl_tlsv1=YES
ssl_sslv2=NO
ssl_sslv3=NO
require_ssl_reuse=NO
ssl_ciphers=HIGH
These settings will enforce SSL/TLS encryption for data transfers and logins. The chroot_local_user=YES option will restrict users to their home directories.

Save and close the file, then restart the vsftpd service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Block other services for the restricted users:
To prevent the restricted users from accessing other services on your machine, you can use a firewall to block traffic from their IP addresses to all ports except those required for SFTP (default: 22) and vsftpd (default: 20 and 21).

First, enable the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) if it's not already enabled:

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw enable
Next, create a rule to allow SFTP and vsftpd traffic from the restricted users' IP addresses. Replace user_ip with the user's IP address:

css
Copy code
sudo ufw allow from user_ip to any port 20
sudo ufw allow from user_ip to any port 21
sudo ufw allow from user_ip to any port 22
Then, create a rule to deny all other traffic from the restricted users' IP addresses:

csharp
Copy code
sudo ufw deny from user_ip
Repeat these steps for each restricted user's IP address.

Please note that this method assumes that the restricted users have static IP addresses. If the users have dynamic IP addresses or connect from multiple locations, this method may not be suitable.

With these configurations, users will only have access to SFTP and vsftpd services on your Ubuntu 22.04 machine and will be blocked from accessing other resources.




User
> Next, create a rule to allow SFTP and vsftpd traffic from the restricted users' IP addresses. Replace user_ip with the user's IP address:

```
sudo ufw allow from user_ip to any port 20
sudo ufw allow from user_ip to any port 21
sudo ufw allow from user_ip to any port 22
```
IP addresses?  How can I forsee the users' IP addresses?

ChatGPT
You're correct; it's not feasible to foresee users' IP addresses, especially if they have dynamic IP addresses or connect from multiple locations. My previous response assumed static IP addresses, which isn't suitable in most cases. I apologize for the confusion.

In this case, you can use another approach to restrict users' access to SFTP and vsftpd services by managing the user's group membership and permissions.

Create a new group for restricted users:
Copy code
sudo groupadd sftp_vsftpd_users
Add the users to the new group:
For each user you want to restrict, run the following command:

Copy code
sudo usermod -aG sftp_vsftpd_users username
Replace username with the actual username.

Restrict access to other services:
To restrict the users from accessing other services on your system, you can either disable those services for the sftp_vsftpd_users group or configure the services to allow access only to specific groups.

For example, if you have a web server running on your machine, you can configure the web server to allow access only to a specific group of users, excluding the sftp_vsftpd_users group.

These steps may vary depending on the services running on your machine and their configurations. It's essential to review the documentation for each service to understand how to configure user access.

Keep in mind that this approach won't completely block network access for the restricted users, but it will prevent them from using other services on the machine where they don't have the required permissions.




User
> Then, create a rule to deny all other traffic from the restricted users' IP addresses:
```
sudo ufw deny from user_ip
```

Can I use a rule similar  to restrict the sftp-only users like this?

ChatGPT
Using UFW to restrict traffic for specific users based on their usernames is not possible because UFW operates on the network level and doesn't have access to user information. UFW rules can be created based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols, but not on usernames.

To restrict sftp-only users from accessing other services on the machine, you can follow the approach mentioned earlier: limit the user's shell and manage their group membership and permissions.

By setting the user's shell to /usr/sbin/nologin or /bin/false and configuring the SSH server to use ForceCommand internal-sftp, you will limit their access to SFTP only. Additionally, you can control access to other services on the machine by managing group memberships and permissions.

Keep in mind that this approach won't completely block network access for the restricted users, but it will prevent them from using other services on the machine where they don't have the required permissions.




User
Could I open SFTP and vsftpd services to any user, as something like this?
```
sudo ufw allow from * to any port 20      # What is the correct command, if there is one?
sudo ufw allow from * to any port 21
sudo ufw allow from * to any port 22
```
If the above settings are possible, I think it is simpler and still safe since only the existing users on my machine can access these services.  Is my understanding correct?

ChatGPT
Yes, you can open SFTP and vsftpd services to any user by allowing traffic to their respective ports. Your understanding is correct; only users with valid credentials on your machine will be able to access these services. To allow traffic on ports 20, 21, and 22 for any IP address, you can use the following commands:

Copy code
sudo ufw allow 20
sudo ufw allow 21
sudo ufw allow 22
These commands will open the respective ports for all incoming traffic, allowing users to connect to the SFTP and vsftpd services on your machine.

However, I would like to clarify that opening these ports will allow anyone to attempt to connect to these services. While only users with valid credentials can access the services, it is still important to follow security best practices such as using strong passwords or key-based authentication, monitoring logs for unauthorized access attempts, and keeping your software up-to-date.




User
Should I restart the ufw after adding rules to it?

ChatGPT
You don't need to restart the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) after adding rules to it. When you add, modify, or delete a rule using the ufw command, the changes are applied immediately.

To verify that your rules have been added correctly, you can use the following command to list the current rules:

lua
Copy code
sudo ufw status verbose
This command will display the current UFW rules, along with their status (active or inactive) and any additional information such as logging settings.




User
I got the following error while trying to connect my vsftpd from a WinSCP Client application.
```
Disconnected from server
Connection failed.
OOPS: vsftpd: cannot locate user specified in 'chown_username':whoever
```

ChatGPT
The error message you received indicates that the vsftpd server is unable to find a user specified in the chown_username configuration option. To resolve this issue, you can either provide a valid username or disable the chown_uploads option.

Option 1: Specify a valid username

Open the vsftpd configuration file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Find the chown_username option in the configuration file. It should look like:
makefile
Copy code
chown_username=whoever
Replace whoever with a valid username on your system. For example, if the valid username is example_user, the line should look like:
makefile
Copy code
chown_username=example_user
Save and close the file.

Restart the vsftpd service to apply the changes:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Option 2: Disable chown_uploads

If you don't want to change the ownership of uploaded files, you can disable the chown_uploads option.

Open the vsftpd configuration file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Find the chown_uploads option in the configuration file. It should look like:
makefile
Copy code
chown_uploads=YES
Change the chown_uploads option to NO:
makefile
Copy code
chown_uploads=NO
Save and close the file.

Restart the vsftpd service to apply the changes:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
After applying either of these changes, try reconnecting with the WinSCP client. The issue should be resolved.




User
> chown_username=example_user

Should I write one seperate line for each allowed user or put them in the same line like this?
```
chown_username=rebecca,asing,alex
```

ChatGPT
The chown_username option in the vsftpd configuration is used to specify a single user that uploaded files will be owned by when the chown_uploads option is enabled. You cannot specify multiple users for the chown_username option.

If you want uploaded files to be owned by the user who uploaded them, you can disable the chown_uploads option.

Open the vsftpd configuration file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Find the chown_uploads option in the configuration file. It should look like:
makefile
Copy code
chown_uploads=YES
Change the chown_uploads option to NO:
makefile
Copy code
chown_uploads=NO
Save and close the file.

Restart the vsftpd service to apply the changes:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
By setting chown_uploads to NO, uploaded files will be owned by the user who uploaded them, and you won't need to specify multiple usernames in the chown_username option.




User
I got another error:
```
Authentication failed.
Disconnected from server
Connection failed.
Non-anonymous sessions must use encryption.
```

ChatGPT
This error occurs when your vsftpd server is configured to require encryption for non-anonymous sessions, but the client is attempting to connect without encryption. To resolve this issue, you need to enable encryption (TLS/SSL) in your FTP client (WinSCP).

To enable encryption in WinSCP:

Open WinSCP and create a new connection or edit an existing one.
In the "File protocol" dropdown, select "FTP".
In the "Encryption" dropdown, choose "TLS/SSL Explicit encryption" instead of "No encryption".
Enter your hostname, username, and password as usual, then click "Login" or "Save" to save the changes.
Now, when you connect to your vsftpd server, the connection will be encrypted, and you should not receive the "Non-anonymous sessions must use encryption" error.




User
When I change the "Encryption" setting to "TLS/SSL Explicit encryption", The WinSCP  told me
```
TLS connection established.  Waiting for welcome message.
Access denied.
```
and  asked the user to enter a password.

However, when the user enters a correct password, the "Access denied" window keeps popping out.

ChatGPT
The "Access denied" error you're encountering could be caused by several factors, such as incorrect configuration settings, a problem with the PAM service, or issues with the SSL/TLS certificates. Let's troubleshoot this issue step by step.

1. Check the vsftpd configuration settings

Open the vsftpd configuration file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Ensure the following settings are enabled (uncommented) or add them if they're missing:

makefile
Copy code
local_enable=YES
write_enable=YES
ssl_enable=YES
allow_anon_ssl=NO
force_local_data_ssl=YES
force_local_logins_ssl=YES
ssl_tlsv1=YES
ssl_sslv2=NO
ssl_sslv3=NO
require_ssl_reuse=NO
ssl_ciphers=HIGH
Save and close the file, then restart the vsftpd service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
2. Check PAM service configuration

The vsftpd server uses PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) for user authentication. Ensure that the PAM service is properly configured for vsftpd.

Open the PAM configuration file for vsftpd:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/vsftpd
Make sure the following lines are present in the file:

swift
Copy code
auth    required        pam_unix.so
account required        pam_unix.so
Save and close the file.

3. Verify SSL/TLS certificates

Make sure the SSL/TLS certificates specified in the vsftpd configuration file are present and have the correct permissions. In the /etc/vsftpd.conf file, look for the following lines:

typescript
Copy code
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
Verify that the certificate files exist at the specified paths:

bash
Copy code
ls -l /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
ls -l /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
If the certificate files are missing or have incorrect permissions, you may need to recreate them or adjust the permissions.

4. Check vsftpd logs for additional information

Check the vsftpd log file for any error messages or additional information that might help diagnose the issue:

bash
Copy code
sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/vsftpd.log
If you find any error messages, they may provide clues to help you resolve the issue.

If you've checked all these settings and the issue persists, there might be other factors causing the "Access denied" error. In that case, consider providing the vsftpd log entries or any additional information to help identify the root cause.




User
I've checked all the settings you provided and the issue persists.

```
sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/vsftpd.log
```

ChatGPT
Based on the log entries you provided, it appears that some login attempts have failed for the users "rebecca" and "oliver", while the user "alex" was able to log in successfully. This suggests that the issue might be related to the specific user accounts or their passwords.

To troubleshoot this issue further, please follow these steps:

1. Verify user accounts and passwords

Ensure that the user accounts "rebecca" and "oliver" exist on the system and that their passwords are correct. You can check the list of user accounts by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo cat /etc/passwd
If you find that the user accounts or passwords are incorrect, you can update them as needed:

To change a user's password, run the following command:
Copy code
sudo passwd username
Replace username with the name of the user whose password you want to change.

If a user account is missing, you can create it by running:
Copy code
sudo adduser username
Replace username with the name of the user you want to create.

2. Check user permissions

Make sure that the users "rebecca" and "oliver" have the necessary permissions to access the FTP directories. Verify that their home directories exist and have the correct permissions:

bash
Copy code
ls -ld /home/rebecca
ls -ld /home/oliver
If the directories are missing or have incorrect permissions, you can create them or adjust the permissions as needed:

To create a user's home directory, run:
bash
Copy code
sudo mkdir /home/username
sudo chown username:username /home/username
Replace username with the name of the user whose home directory you want to create.

To adjust a user's home directory permissions, run:
bash
Copy code
sudo chown username:username /home/username
sudo chmod 755 /home/username
Replace username with the name of the user whose home directory permissions you want to adjust.

After making these changes, restart the vsftpd service and try logging in again:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
If the issue persists, please provide any additional log entries or error messages to help identify the root cause.

It appears that the login attempts for users "rebecca" and "oliver" are still failing, while the user "alex" can log in successfully. Let's check if the users have the proper FTP access settings in the vsftpd configuration file.

Open the vsftpd configuration file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Make sure that local users are allowed to log in by verifying that the following line exists and is not commented out:
makefile
Copy code
local_enable=YES
Check if any user-specific configurations exist in the vsftpd configuration file. Look for lines that contain the names of the users that are having issues (i.e., "rebecca" and "oliver"). If you find any such lines, please share them here, as they may be causing the login issues.

Also, check for a userlist configuration. If the following lines are present, make sure that "rebecca" and "oliver" are included in the userlist file:

makefile
Copy code
userlist_enable=YES
userlist_file=/etc/vsftpd.userlist
userlist_deny=NO
The userlist file should contain one username per line. If the users are missing, add them to the file:

bash
Copy code
sudo echo "rebecca" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
sudo echo "oliver" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
Save the changes to the configuration file and restart the vsftpd service:
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Now, try logging in again with the affected user accounts. If the issue persists, please share any additional log entries or relevant configuration lines from the vsftpd configuration file.




User

After checking the steps you provided,  the client(WinSCP) got the following error:
```
Authentication failed.
Server asks for authentication with a client certificate.
Connection failed.
Permission denied.
```

ChatGPT
This error suggests that the server is requesting client certificate authentication. Let's disable client certificate authentication in the vsftpd configuration file to resolve the issue.

Open the vsftpd configuration file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Look for the following lines in the configuration file. If they are present, comment them out by adding a # at the beginning of the line:
shell
Copy code
#ssl_client_cert_auth=YES
#ssl_client_cert_ca_path=/path/to/cert_authority
If you don't find the lines mentioned above, add the following line to disable client certificate authentication explicitly:
makefile
Copy code
ssl_client_cert_auth=NO
Save the changes to the configuration file and restart the vsftpd service:
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Now, try connecting again using WinSCP. This should resolve the "Permission denied" error caused by client certificate authentication.




User
After setting ssl_client_cert_auth=NO,  the WinSCP client got the previous error:

```
TLS connection established.  Waiting for welcome message.
Access denied.
```
and  asked the user to enter a password.

ChatGPT
I apologize for the inconvenience. Let's try another approach to resolve the issue.

Open the vsftpd configuration file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Add the following lines to the configuration file to explicitly allow local users and force SSL for both data and control connections:
makefile
Copy code
local_enable=YES
write_enable=YES
force_local_data_ssl=YES
force_local_logins_ssl=YES
Make sure the following line is present and not commented out:
makefile
Copy code
ssl_enable=YES
Save the changes to the configuration file and restart the vsftpd service:
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Now, try connecting again using WinSCP with "TLS/SSL Explicit encryption". If you still encounter issues, please provide the output of the following command to check the vsftpd configuration:

perl
Copy code
sudo grep -v '^#' /etc/vsftpd.conf | grep -v '^$'
This command will display the active configuration lines without comments or empty lines.

Modify the configuration file to match the following:
makefile
Copy code
listen=NO
listen_ipv6=YES
anonymous_enable=NO
local_enable=YES
write_enable=YES
local_umask=022
dirmessage_enable=YES

rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
Save the changes to the configuration file and restart the vsftpd service:
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Now, try connecting again using WinSCP with "TLS/SSL Explicit encryption". If you still encounter issues, please let me know, and we'll investigate further.




User
> Modify the configuration file to match the following:

Do you mean changing the whole original content of /etc/vsftpd.conf with the commands you provided?

ChatGPT
Yes, I recommend replacing the original content of /etc/vsftpd.conf with the configuration settings I provided to ensure that there are no conflicting or redundant settings in the file. This will help to create a clean and consistent configuration for vsftpd.

Remember to make a backup of your original configuration file before making changes, in case you need to revert the changes later:

bash
Copy code
sudo cp /etc/vsftpd.conf /etc/vsftpd.conf.bak
Once you have replaced the content of /etc/vsftpd.conf with the settings I provided, save the changes and restart the vsftpd service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Then, try connecting again using WinSCP with "TLS/SSL Explicit encryption". If you still encounter issues, please let me know, and we'll investigate further.




User
After replacing the original content of /etc/vsftpd.conf with the configuration settings you provided,  the WinSCP client still got the same error while trying to login with rebecca and oliver:

```
TLS connection established.  Waiting for welcome message.
Access denied.

Please note the time.  The log file dosn't record the lastest login attempts.  The last log item keeps login attempt several hours ago.

ChatGPT
It seems that the log file is not being updated with the latest login attempts. Let's first address the logging issue, so we have more information to diagnose the connection problem.

Edit the vsftpd configuration file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Add or modify the following lines to enable detailed logging:
makefile
Copy code
xferlog_enable=YES
xferlog_std_format=NO
log_ftp_protocol=YES
These settings will enable logging of FTP protocol and commands. Save the changes and exit the editor.

Restart the vsftpd service:
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Retry the login attempts using WinSCP with both users (rebecca and oliver).

Check the log file again:

bash
Copy code
sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/vsftpd.log

I apologize for the inconvenience. Since the log file is not updating, let's try to create a new log file and point vsftpd to use it.

Create a new log file:
bash
Copy code
sudo touch /var/log/vsftpd_new.log
sudo chown syslog:adm /var/log/vsftpd_new.log
sudo chmod 640 /var/log/vsftpd_new.log
Edit the vsftpd configuration file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Add or modify the following line to point to the new log file:
c
Copy code
vsftpd_log_file=/var/log/vsftpd_new.log
Save the changes and exit the editor.

Restart the vsftpd service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Retry the login attempts using WinSCP with both users (rebecca and oliver).

Check the new log file:

bash
Copy code
sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/vsftpd_new.log
Please share the latest log entries after performing these steps. This will help us better understand the cause of the connection issue.

I apologize for the ongoing issues. Let's try another approach to enable more verbose logging for vsftpd.

Edit the /etc/vsftpd.conf file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Add the following lines to the configuration file:
makefile
Copy code
log_ftp_protocol=YES
debug_ssl=YES
Save the changes and exit the editor.

Restart the vsftpd service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Retry the login attempts using WinSCP with both users (rebecca and oliver).

Check the /var/log/syslog file for vsftpd logs:

perl
Copy code
sudo grep vsftpd /var/log/syslog
Please share the latest log entries from /var/log/syslog. This should help us better understand the cause of the connection issue.

ChatGPT
It appears that vsftpd is failing to start properly, which is likely causing the connection issues. The log indicates that the main process is exiting with an "INVALIDARGUMENT" status.

Let's try to identify and fix the problem in the configuration file.

Check the /etc/vsftpd.conf file for any syntax errors or invalid arguments. Make sure all lines you've added previously are correct, and there are no typos or extra characters.

Remove or comment out the following lines if they exist in the configuration file:

makefile
Copy code
debug_ssl=YES
This option is not available in all versions of vsftpd and could be causing issues. You can comment out a line by adding a # at the beginning of the line.

Save the changes and exit the editor.

Restart the vsftpd service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Check the status of the vsftpd service:
lua
Copy code
sudo systemctl status vsftpd
If the service is running properly, you should see a message similar to Active: active (running).

Retry the login attempts using WinSCP with both users (rebecca and oliver).

Check the /var/log/syslog file for vsftpd logs:

perl
Copy code
sudo grep vsftpd /var/log/syslog
If the problem persists, please share the latest log entries from /var/log/syslog and the current /etc/vsftpd.conf file.

ChatGPT
Based on the logs and the output of systemctl status vsftpd, it appears that the vsftpd service is failing to start due to an invalid argument (status=2/INVALIDARGUMENT).

To troubleshoot this issue, you should examine the vsftpd configuration file to identify any syntax errors or invalid settings. The configuration file is typically located at /etc/vsftpd.conf. You can use a text editor, such as nano or vim, to open the file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Check for any typos, incorrect settings, or misconfigurations. If you're unsure about a particular setting, you can refer to the vsftpd documentation or search online for examples.

Once you've made any necessary changes, save the file and exit the text editor. Then, try restarting the vsftpd service again:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Check the status of the service to see if it has started successfully:

lua
Copy code
sudo systemctl status vsftpd
If the service still fails to start, you can examine the logs for more detailed error messages:

perl
Copy code
sudo grep vsftpd /var/log/syslog
Keep adjusting the configuration file and checking the logs until you resolve the issue and the vsftpd service starts successfully.

ChatGPT
The configuration you provided appears to be correct, and there don't seem to be any typos or incorrect settings. However, there might be an issue with the SSL certificate files, or the vsftpd service might not have permission to access them. To check the existence and permissions of the certificate files, run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
ls -l /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
ls -l /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
If the files don't exist or have incorrect permissions, you can either adjust the permissions or generate new self-signed certificates:

Generate a new self-signed certificate:
bash
Copy code
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.crt
Update the vsftpd.conf file with the new certificate file paths:
typescript
Copy code
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.crt
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key
Restart the vsftpd service:
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Check the status of the service:
lua
Copy code
sudo systemctl status vsftpd
If the issue persists, examine the logs again for more detailed error messages:

perl
Copy code
sudo grep vsftpd /var/log/syslog
Additionally, ensure that the /var/run/vsftpd/empty directory exists and has the correct permissions. You can create the directory and set the correct permissions with the following commands:

bash
Copy code
sudo mkdir -p /var/run/vsftpd/empty
sudo chown root:root /var/run/vsftpd/empty
sudo chmod 755 /var/run/vsftpd/empty



User
`sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.crt
`
does `-days 365` mean the self-signed certificates are valid only for one year?  Can I extent the period to multiple years?

ChatGPT
Yes, the -days 365 option means that the self-signed certificate is valid for 365 days, or one year. You can extend the validity period by specifying a different value for the -days option. For example, if you want the certificate to be valid for 10 years, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.crt
In this example, the -days 3650 option extends the validity period to 3,650 days, which is equivalent to 10 years. Keep in mind that using a long expiration period might reduce the overall security of your setup, so it's important to balance convenience with security.

The vsftpd service is still failing to start. To further investigate the issue, let's check the vsftpd log file you've specified in the vsftpd.conf file:

bash
Copy code
sudo cat /var/log/vsftpd_new.log
Additionally, since the certificate files were updated, it's also important to ensure that the vsftpd process can access them. Make sure the permissions and ownership of the certificate files are correct:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown root:root /etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.crt
sudo chown root:root /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key
sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssl/certs/vsftpd.crt
sudo chmod 640 /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key
After setting the correct permissions and ownership, try restarting the vsftpd service again:

lua
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
sudo systemctl status vsftpd
If the issue persists, please provide the output from the vsftpd_new.log file so we can further analyze the problem.




User
Bad news.  The issue does persist.

ChatGPT
It seems that the log file is empty, which indicates that vsftpd might not be writing any logs or there might be an issue with the logging configuration.

Let's try running vsftpd in the foreground with verbose logging enabled to see if it provides any useful information:

bash
Copy code
sudo /usr/sbin/vsftpd /etc/vsftpd.conf -opasv_enable=YES -oftp_data_port=0 -d
This command will run vsftpd with the configuration file you've specified, enable passive mode, set the FTP data port to 0 (allowing the OS to choose an ephemeral port), and enable verbose debugging mode. Watch the output for any error messages or warnings.

If you see any relevant information in the output, please share it so we can further investigate the issue.




User
$ sudo /usr/sbin/vsftpd /etc/vsftpd.conf -opasv_enable=YES -oftp_data_port=0 -d

Apologies for the confusion, the correct flag for enabling debugging in vsftpd is -debug. Please try running the command with the correct flag:

bash
Copy code
sudo /usr/sbin/vsftpd /etc/vsftpd.conf -opasv_enable=YES -oftp_data_port=0 -debug
This will run vsftpd with the configuration file you've specified, enable passive mode, set the FTP data port to 0 (allowing the OS to choose an ephemeral port), and enable verbose debugging mode. Watch the output for any error messages or warnings.

If you see any relevant information in the output, please share it so we can further investigate the issue.




User
Still not working...
500 OOPS: unrecognise option: -debug

ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. It appears that the version of vsftpd you are using does not support the -debug flag. In that case, let's try a different approach.

First, please make sure that your vsftpd configuration file has the log_ftp_protocol option set to YES:

makefile
Copy code
log_ftp_protocol=YES
This option will ensure that all FTP commands and responses are logged, which will help us diagnose the issue. Save the configuration file and restart the vsftpd service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Now, try connecting to your FTP server again. If the issue persists, check the /var/log/vsftpd_new.log file for any relevant log entries:

bash

I apologize for the inconvenience. Since the log file does not show any output, let's try another approach to get more information about the issue.

Stop the vsftpd service:
arduino
Copy code
sudo systemctl stop vsftpd
Run vsftpd directly in the foreground with verbose logging:
bash
Copy code
sudo /usr/sbin/vsftpd /etc/vsftpd.conf
This will run vsftpd in the foreground and print log messages directly to your terminal. Now, try connecting to your FTP server again. Observe the output in your terminal for any error messages or relevant log entries.

If you see any error messages or log entries, please share them, and we can use that information to further investigate the issue.

500 OOPS: could not bind listening IPv6 socket

ChatGPT
Thank you for providing the error message. It appears that vsftpd is having trouble binding to the IPv6 socket. Let's try disabling IPv6 and enable IPv4 only in your vsftpd.conf configuration file.

Open /etc/vsftpd.conf with a text editor, such as nano:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Change the following lines:
From:

makefile
Copy code
listen=NO
listen_ipv6=YES
To:

makefile
Copy code
listen=YES
listen_ipv6=NO
Save the changes and exit the text editor.

Restart the vsftpd service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Check the status of the vsftpd service:
lua
Copy code
sudo systemctl status vsftpd
If the issue persists, please provide the output of the following command:

perl
Copy code
sudo ss -tuln | grep -E 'ftp|21'

Thank you for providing the output. It seems that another process is already using port 21, which is causing the vsftpd service to fail. To find the process that is using port 21, run the following command:

css
Copy code
sudo lsof -i :21
Once you have identified the process, you can either stop that process or change the port used by vsftpd.

To change the port used by vsftpd:

Open /etc/vsftpd.conf with a text editor, such as nano:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Add the following line to set a new listening port (replace 2121 with your desired port number):
makefile
Copy code
listen_port=2121
Save the changes and exit the text editor.

Restart the vsftpd service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Check the status of the vsftpd service:
lua
Copy code
sudo systemctl status vsftpd
If you still encounter issues, please provide the output of the following commands:

css
Copy code
sudo lsof -i :21
sudo lsof -i :2121

alex@srv:/home$ sudo lsof -i :21

filezilla 2545 root   11u  IPv6 2122583      0t0  TCP *:ftp (LISTEN)

I guess the issue is caused by a running filezilla.  Am I correct?
If I would like to stop filezilla, and make filezilla DOSN'T start automatically after rebooting the system, what should I do?

ChatGPT
Yes, the output indicates that FileZilla is running and listening on port 21. To stop FileZilla and prevent it from starting automatically after rebooting the system, follow these steps:

Stop the FileZilla server:
bash
Copy code
sudo kill 2545
To prevent FileZilla from starting automatically after rebooting, you need to identify the service or process that starts FileZilla on boot. It could be a systemd service, a SysV init script, or a cron job.
First, check if there's a systemd service related to FileZilla:

css
Copy code
sudo systemctl list-unit-files | grep -i filezilla
If you find a related service, disable it using:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl disable <service_name>
Replace <service_name> with the name of the FileZilla-related service you found.

If there's no systemd service, check for a SysV init script in the /etc/init.d directory:
bash
Copy code
ls /etc/init.d/ | grep -i filezilla
If you find a related script, remove the corresponding symbolic links from the /etc/rc*.d directories:

arduino
Copy code
sudo update-rc.d -f <script_name> remove
Replace <script_name> with the name of the FileZilla-related script you found.

Finally, check for a cron job related to FileZilla:
Copy code
sudo crontab -l
If you find an entry related to FileZilla, remove it by editing the crontab file:

Copy code
sudo crontab -e
Remove the line related to FileZilla, save the changes, and exit the editor.

After completing these steps, FileZilla should be stopped, and it should not start automatically when the system is rebooted. Now, you can restart the vsftpd service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Check the status of the vsftpd service:

lua
Copy code
sudo systemctl status vsftpd

Does it indicate the FileZilla service will not start automatically after rebooting?
BTW, what does the 'enabled' in
"filezilla-server.service                                                  disabled        enabled"
mean?

ChatGPT
Yes, the output indicates that the FileZilla service has been disabled and will not start automatically after rebooting.

The filezilla-server.service line you see in the output has two fields. The first field shows the service's current state (whether it's enabled or disabled), and the second field shows the service's vendor preset state.

In this case, "disabled" in the first field indicates that the service is currently disabled and won't start automatically at boot. The "enabled" in the second field means that the vendor's default setting for this service is to start automatically at boot. However, since you've disabled the service, it will not start automatically, regardless of the vendor preset state.

Now you can restart the vsftpd service and check its status:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
sudo systemctl status vsftpd

Great! The output shows that the vsftpd service is now running successfully. The "Active: active (running)" line indicates that the service is up and running, and there are no errors reported.

You should now be able to use your FTP server with the configured settings. Don't forget to test the connection to your FTP server with an FTP client or another method to ensure everything is working as expected.

Wed Apr 19 01:16:58 2023 [pid 195018] [rebecca] FTP response: Client "1.34.184.226", "530 Permission denied."

ChatGPT
The log output shows that the client is connecting successfully but encountering a "530 Permission denied" error when trying to log in with the username "rebecca". This error usually indicates that there is a problem with the user's authentication or permission.

Please double-check the following:

Verify that the user "rebecca" exists on your system and has a valid home directory.
Make sure the user "rebecca" is listed in the /etc/vsftpd.userlist file, as you have enabled userlist_enable=YES and userlist_deny=NO in your vsftpd.conf.
Check the permissions of the home directory of the user "rebecca" and ensure that they have read and write permissions.
Verify that the PAM configuration for vsftpd (/etc/pam.d/vsftpd) is set up correctly. It should look like this by default:
swift
Copy code
auth required pam_unix.so nullok
account required pam_unix.so
session required pam_unix.so
Check the /var/log/auth.log file for any additional information related to the authentication failure.
After checking these points, if the issue persists, please provide the output of the /var/log/auth.log file (filtered for relevant entries) to help diagnose the problem further.




User
1. user "rebecca" does exist:
alex@srv:/home$ grep -E '^UID_MIN|^UID_MAX' /etc/login.defs
UID_MIN			 1000
UID_MAX			60000
alex@srv:/home$ getent passwd {1000..60000}

thomas:x:1009:1011:,,,:/home/thomas:/bin/bash

2.  user "rebecca" is listed in the /etc/vsftpd.userlist file:
alex@srv:/home$ cat /etc/vsftpd.userlist
sudo echo "rebecca" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
sudo echo "asing" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
sudo echo "thomas" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
sudo echo "oliver" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist

And I have enabled userlist_enable=YES and userlist_deny=NO in my vsftpd.conf.

3. Check the permissions of the home directory of the user "rebecca" and ensure that they have read and write permissions.
alex@srv:/home$ ll rebecca
總用量 8
drwxr-xr-x  2 rebecca rebecca 4096  4月 18 09:44 ./
drwxr-xr-x 10 root    root    4096  4月 18 09:44 ../

4. Verify that the PAM configuration for vsftpd (/etc/pam.d/vsftpd) is set up correctly.
Please help verify if the configuration is set up correctly:

alex@srv:/home$ cat /etc/pam.d/vsftpd
# Standard behaviour for ftpd(8).
#auth	required	pam_listfile.so item=user sense=deny file=/etc/ftpusers onerr=succeed


#auth    required        pam_unix.so
#account required        pam_unix.so


# Note: vsftpd handles anonymous logins on its own. Do not enable pam_ftp.so.

# Standard pam includes
@include common-account
@include common-session
@include common-auth
auth	required	pam_shells.so

auth required pam_unix.so nullok
account required pam_unix.so
session required pam_unix.so

5. Check the /var/log/auth.log file for any additional information related to the authentication failure.
There is no such file.

ChatGPT
Thank you for providing the information. It seems that the PAM configuration is correct, and the user is correctly set up. The issue might be related to the user's shell. In the information you provided, the user "rebecca" has the shell set to /bin/false, which might be causing the problem.

To fix this, you can change the user's shell to /sbin/nologin. This shell prevents the user from logging in interactively but still allows them to use FTP.

Run the following command to change the shell for the user "rebecca":

bash
Copy code
sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin rebecca
After changing the shell, restart the vsftpd service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Now, try connecting to the FTP server using WinSCP again.

Regarding the /var/log/auth.log file not being present, it is possible that your system uses a different log file for authentication events. You can check the /var/log/syslog file for any authentication-related information if the issue persists.

Please let me know if this resolves the issue or if you need further assistance.

The contents of the /var/log/auth.log show various activities performed by user 'alex'. They include:

Disabling the filezilla-server.service.
Listing unit files using systemctl.
Restarting and checking the status of the vsftpd service multiple times.
Opening and closing sessions with sudo and cron jobs running as the root user.
Reading the contents of /var/log/vsftpd_new.log and /var/log/autho.log.
Modifying the shell for user 'rebecca' from '/bin/false' to '/sbin/nologin'.
No suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts are apparent in this log excerpt.




User
The same issue persists.

ChatGPT
I apologize for the inconvenience. Let's try another approach to troubleshoot the issue.

Verify the vsftpd configuration file.
Ensure that the user is allowed to access the FTP server. Check the configuration file /etc/vsftpd.conf for settings related to the user or user list. Make sure there are no rules preventing the user 'rebecca' from accessing the FTP server.

Check the user's home directory and permissions.
Make sure the user 'rebecca' has a valid home directory and appropriate permissions set. You can check the home directory using the following command:

bash
Copy code
grep rebecca /etc/passwd
Ensure the home directory exists and has the correct ownership and permissions. Use these commands to check and modify permissions if needed:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown rebecca:rebecca /path/to/home/directory
sudo chmod 755 /path/to/home/directory
Check the firewall settings.
If a firewall is enabled on your system, make sure it allows incoming connections to the FTP server. Use the following command to check the firewall status:

lua
Copy code
sudo ufw status
If necessary, add a rule to allow incoming connections to the FTP server:

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw allow 20/tcp
sudo ufw allow 21/tcp
After making any changes, restart the vsftpd service and try connecting again:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
If the issue persists after trying these steps, please provide any error messages or logs you encounter for further assistance.

Thank you for providing the details. It seems that the user 'rebecca' has /sbin/nologin as the shell in the /etc/passwd file. This means that the user is not allowed to log in via FTP. To fix this, you need to change the shell to a valid one, such as /bin/bash.

Change the shell for the user 'rebecca':
To change the shell, you can use the usermod command:

bash
Copy code
sudo usermod -s /bin/bash rebecca
Restart the vsftpd service:
After changing the shell, restart the vsftpd service to apply the changes:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Try connecting again:
With the shell changed and the vsftpd service restarted, try connecting to the FTP server using the 'rebecca' user again.

If the issue persists, please provide any error messages or logs for further assistance.




User
1. Change the shell for the user 'rebecca':
Changed

2. Restart the vsftpd service:
Restarted.

3. Try connecting again:
Still got Connection failed error using WinSCP Client:
Authentication failed.
Server asks for authentication with a client certicicate.
Connection failed.
Permission denied.

ChatGPT
It appears that the server is asking for authentication with a client certificate, which is not a typical FTP configuration. This might be the reason why the connection is failing. Let's disable SSL/TLS settings in the vsftpd configuration file to check if that resolves the issue.

Edit the vsftpd configuration file:
Open the vsftpd configuration file with a text editor, like nano:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Disable SSL/TLS settings:
Find the following lines in the configuration file and comment them out by adding a # symbol at the beginning of each line:

shell
Copy code
# rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
# rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
# ssl_enable=YES
If you find any other SSL/TLS related settings, comment them out as well.

Save and close the configuration file:
Press CTRL+X, then Y, and finally ENTER to save and close the file.

Restart the vsftpd service:
Restart the vsftpd service to apply the changes:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Try connecting again:
With SSL/TLS settings disabled, try connecting to the FTP server using the 'rebecca' user again.

If the issue persists, please provide any error messages or logs for further assistance.

It seems that the issue might not be related to SSL/TLS settings. Let's try the following steps to identify and resolve the problem:

Enable more verbose logging in vsftpd configuration:
Edit the vsftpd configuration file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Add the following line at the end of the file to enable verbose logging:

lua
Copy code
debug=YES
Save and close the configuration file by pressing CTRL+X, then Y, and finally ENTER.

Restart the vsftpd service:
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Try connecting again:
Attempt to connect to the FTP server using the 'rebecca' user.

Check the log file:
After the connection attempt, check the vsftpd log file for any error messages or details about the failed connection:

bash
Copy code
sudo cat /var/log/vsftpd_new.log
Please provide any relevant log entries or error messages for further assistance.

It looks like the user "rebecca" is repeatedly getting a "530 Permission denied" error, which suggests that the user does not have the correct permissions to access the server. To resolve this issue, you can follow these steps:

Check if the user "rebecca" exists on the system. You can do this by running the following command:

Copy code
sudo getent passwd rebecca
If the user doesn't exist, create the user by running:

Copy code
sudo adduser rebecca
Make sure the user "rebecca" is part of the allowed users or user groups in the vsftpd configuration file /etc/vsftpd.conf. You can look for directives like userlist_enable, userlist_file, userlist_deny, and local_enable. If necessary, modify these directives to allow the user "rebecca" to access the server.

Make sure the user "rebecca" has the correct permissions to access the desired directory. You can do this by running the following command, replacing /path/to/directory with the actual directory path:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown rebecca:rebecca /path/to/directory
sudo chmod 755 /path/to/directory
If you are using chroot jails in your vsftpd configuration (the directive chroot_local_user is set to YES), ensure that the user's home directory is properly set up and that the user has read and write permissions for their home directory.

After making any necessary changes, restart the vsftpd service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Now, the user "rebecca" should be able to access the FTP server without the "530 Permission denied" error. If the issue persists, please provide more details about your vsftpd configuration, and I'll be happy to help you further.

It seems the vsftpd.userlist is correct.  Please verify for me.

alex@srv:/home$ cat /etc/vsftpd.userlist
sudo echo "rebecca" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
sudo echo "asing" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
sudo echo "thomas" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
sudo echo "oliver" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist

ChatGPT
Based on the provided information, your /etc/vsftpd.conf file seems to be configured correctly. However, there's an issue with your /etc/vsftpd.userlist file. The contents of the file should be the list of allowed users, but instead, it has the commands used to add users to the list.

To fix the /etc/vsftpd.userlist file, please follow these steps:

Clear the existing content of the file:
bash
Copy code
sudo truncate -s 0 /etc/vsftpd.userlist
Add the users to the list:
bash
Copy code
echo "rebecca" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
echo "asing" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
echo "thomas" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
echo "oliver" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
Verify the contents of the file:
bash
Copy code
cat /etc/vsftpd.userlist
After updating the /etc/vsftpd.userlist file, restart the vsftpd service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Now try connecting again with an FTP client. If the issue persists, double-check your FTP client settings and ensure that you are using the correct hostname/IP, port, and credentials.

2. Add the users to the list:
echo "rebecca" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
echo "asing" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
echo "thomas" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
echo "oliver" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist

However, it seems to be almost the same as the original content:
alex@srv:/home$ cat /etc/vsftpd.userlist
sudo echo "rebecca" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
sudo echo "asing" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
sudo echo "thomas" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
sudo echo "oliver" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist

Please clarify my doubt.

ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. I see that the provided commands were not clear enough. The contents of the /etc/vsftpd.userlist file you provided contain the commands themselves, not the actual user names.

Please follow the steps below to correct the /etc/vsftpd.userlist file:

Clear the existing content of the file:
bash
Copy code
sudo truncate -s 0 /etc/vsftpd.userlist
Add the users to the list:
bash
Copy code
echo "rebecca" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
echo "asing" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
echo "thomas" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
echo "oliver" | sudo tee -a /etc/vsftpd.userlist
These commands will directly add the user names to the /etc/vsftpd.userlist file, without including the echo or sudo commands themselves.

Verify the contents of the file:
bash
Copy code
cat /etc/vsftpd.userlist
The output should now display the user names only, like this:

Copy code
rebecca
asing
thomas
oliver
Once the /etc/vsftpd.userlist file is updated, restart the vsftpd service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Try connecting again with an FTP client. If the issue persists, double-check your FTP client settings and ensure that you are using the correct hostname/IP, port, and credentials.




User
I am sorry for my misunderstanding.  Now the vsftpd.userlist has been correctly set.
alex@srv:/home$ cat /etc/vsftpd.userlist
rebecca
asing
thomas
oliver

And vsftpd has been restarted.

But the client still got Connection failed.

Based on the log, the issue seems to be related to the authentication process. The 530 Permission denied. error indicates that the user 'rebecca' is not able to log in.

Let's check the PAM configuration file for vsftpd to ensure it is correctly set up:

Open the /etc/pam.d/vsftpd file with a text editor (e.g., nano):
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/vsftpd
Ensure that the file has the following two lines:
text
Copy code
auth required pam_unix.so
account required pam_unix.so
Save the changes and exit the text editor (Ctrl + X, then press Y and Enter for nano).

Restart the vsftpd service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Try connecting again with an FTP client using the correct hostname/IP, port, and credentials.
If the issue persists, please provide the output of the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status vsftpd
This command will show the current status of the vsftpd service, which might help us identify any issues with the service itself.

Are the settings correct?

ChatGPT
The settings in your /etc/pam.d/vsftpd file seem to be mostly correct. However, there is a line that could be causing problems:

swift
Copy code
auth	required	pam_shells.so
The pam_shells.so module checks if the user's shell is listed in the /etc/shells file. If it's not, the authentication will fail. To avoid this issue, you can either comment out that line or make sure that the user's shell is listed in the /etc/shells file.

To comment out the line, update the /etc/pam.d/vsftpd file as follows:

text
Copy code
# Standard behaviour for ftpd(8).
#auth	required	pam_listfile.so item=user sense=deny file=/etc/ftpusers onerr=succeed


#auth    required        pam_unix.so
#account required        pam_unix.so


# Note: vsftpd handles anonymous logins on its own. Do not enable pam_ftp.so.

# Standard pam includes
@include common-account
@include common-session
@include common-auth
#auth	required	pam_shells.so

auth required pam_unix.so nullok
account required pam_unix.so
session required pam_unix.so
After making the changes, save the file, and restart the vsftpd service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Now try connecting with the FTP client again using the correct hostname/IP, port, and credentials.

If you still have issues, check the /etc/shells file and make sure the user's shell is listed there.

It seems like the vsftpd service has failed to start. The issue could be related to the configuration file /etc/vsftpd.conf. Let's first check the syntax of the configuration file.

Run the following command to check for syntax errors in the /etc/vsftpd.conf file:

bash
Copy code
sudo vsftpd /etc/vsftpd.conf
If you see any error messages, correct the issues in the /etc/vsftpd.conf file and try starting the service again.

If the syntax is correct, let's make sure the /var/run/vsftpd/empty directory exists and has the correct permissions. Run these commands to create the directory and set the permissions:

bash
Copy code
sudo mkdir -p /var/run/vsftpd/empty
sudo chown root:root /var/run/vsftpd/empty
sudo chmod 755 /var/run/vsftpd/empty
Now, try starting the vsftpd service again:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start vsftpd
sudo systemctl status vsftpd
If the service starts successfully, try connecting with the FTP client again using the correct hostname/IP, port, and credentials.

If you still face issues, please share the contents of your /etc/vsftpd.conf file so I can help you further.

500 OOPS: unrecognised variable in config file: debug

ChatGPT
It appears that there is an unrecognized variable debug in your /etc/vsftpd.conf file. The correct variable to enable debug mode in vsftpd is debug_ssl.

Open the /etc/vsftpd.conf file using a text editor:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Find the line with debug and either remove it or replace it with the correct variable debug_ssl. If you want to enable debug mode for SSL/TLS, you can set the value to YES:

makefile
Copy code
debug_ssl=YES
Save the changes and exit the text editor.

Now, restart the vsftpd service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
sudo systemctl status vsftpd
Check if the service starts successfully and try connecting with the FTP client again using the correct hostname/IP, port, and credentials.

ChatGPT
It seems that the client is trying to use a secure connection (AUTH TLS or AUTH SSL), but vsftpd is not configured to support SSL/TLS.

To enable SSL/TLS support in vsftpd, you need to add the following settings in your /etc/vsftpd.conf file:

makefile
Copy code
ssl_enable=YES
allow_anon_ssl=NO
force_local_data_ssl=YES
force_local_logins_ssl=YES
ssl_tlsv1=YES
ssl_sslv2=NO
ssl_sslv3=NO
Additionally, you need to provide the path to a valid SSL certificate and key. You can either use an existing SSL certificate or create a self-signed certificate.

To create a self-signed certificate, you can run the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem -out /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem
This will create a new self-signed certificate and key named vsftpd.pem in the /etc/ssl/private/ directory, which will be valid for 365 days.

After creating the certificate, add the following lines to your /etc/vsftpd.conf file to specify the paths for the certificate and key:

typescript
Copy code
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem
Once you have made these changes, restart the vsftpd service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Now, the client should be able to connect using a secure connection (AUTH TLS or AUTH SSL).




User
After the above settings, it seems that the WinSCP client is connecting my vsftpd.

However,  an error occurs when it tries to read remote directory:

Server sent passive reply with unroutable address 192.168.0.100, using host address instead.
Timeout detected. (data connection)
Could not retrieve directory listing
Error listing directory "/".

ChatGPT
This issue is likely caused by the server being behind a NAT (Network Address Translation) or a firewall, and the client not being able to connect to the server's passive mode address.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

In your /etc/vsftpd.conf file, add the following settings:

makefile
Copy code
pasv_enable=YES
pasv_min_port=40000
pasv_max_port=50000
This enables passive mode and sets a range of ports that the server will use for passive mode connections. You can adjust the port range to your preference, but ensure that it does not conflict with other services on your server.

If your server is behind a NAT, add the following setting in your /etc/vsftpd.conf file:

makefile
Copy code
pasv_address=<your_public_IP_address>
Replace <your_public_IP_address> with the public IP address of your server. This setting tells vsftpd to send the public IP address in the passive mode response instead of the local IP address.

If your server is behind a firewall, make sure to open and forward the passive mode port range (in this example, ports 40000-50000) to your server's local IP address.

Restart the vsftpd service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Now, the client should be able to connect and retrieve the directory listing without issues.




User
> If your server is behind a firewall, make sure to open and forward the passive mode port range (in this example, ports 40000-50000) to your server's local IP address.

I was wondering if you might tell me how to do the above setting.

ChatGPT
Certainly! To open and forward the passive mode port range, you'll need to configure your firewall and/or router. The process may vary depending on your firewall/router model and the software you're using. I'll provide general guidance below, but you may need to consult your firewall/router's documentation for specific instructions.

Configure your firewall:

If you're using ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) on your server, follow these steps to open the passive mode port range:

a. Run the following command to allow incoming connections on the port range:

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw allow 40000:50000/tcp
b. Check the updated firewall status:

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw status
You should see the passive mode port range in the list of allowed connections.

Configure your router:

You'll need to set up port forwarding on your router to forward the passive mode port range to your server's local IP address. While the process varies between router models, the general steps are:

a. Log in to your router's administration interface (usually accessible via a web browser).

b. Find the "Port Forwarding" or "Virtual Servers" section.

c. Add a new port forwarding rule for the passive mode port range (in this example, 40000-50000) and specify the protocol as TCP.

d. Enter your server's local IP address as the destination address.

e. Save the settings and restart your router if necessary.

Once you've completed these steps, your server should be accessible by the client using the passive mode, and it should be able to retrieve the directory listing without issues. If you still encounter problems, double-check your firewall and router settings, and consult their documentation for any additional requirements.




User
Bingo!
After going a long long road, client and vsftpd has successfully connected at last.

However, the client is facing another issue.  They can't transfer files to, or create subdirectories on the remote site.  I think that would be a permission problem.

Furthor more, I would like to change clients' home from their default directories to other directories and grant them full permissions on their new directories.  Would you mind providing a step-by-step guide for me?

ChatGPT
Of course! I'll provide a step-by-step guide for changing the home directory for FTP users and granting them full permissions in their new directories.

Change the user's home directory:

Use the usermod command to change the home directory for a specific user. Replace username with the actual username and /new/home/directory with the desired home directory:

bash
Copy code
sudo usermod -d /new/home/directory username
Note: Make sure the new directory exists. If it doesn't, create it using mkdir:

bash
Copy code
sudo mkdir -p /new/home/directory
Change the ownership of the new home directory:

To grant full permissions to the user, change the ownership of the new home directory to the user. Replace username and /new/home/directory accordingly:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown username:username /new/home/directory
Set the correct permissions for the new home directory:

To grant read, write, and execute permissions to the user for their home directory, use the chmod command:

bash
Copy code
sudo chmod 700 /new/home/directory
This command grants full permissions to the owner (the user) and no permissions to others.

Update the vsftpd configuration:

Open /etc/vsftpd.conf in a text editor:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Add or modify the following lines to configure vsftpd to use local user directories as home directories:

makefile
Copy code
local_root=/new/home/directory
chroot_local_user=YES
allow_writeable_chroot=YES
The local_root directive sets the home directory for local users. The chroot_local_user directive restricts users to their home directories. The allow_writeable_chroot directive enables users to write to their home directories.

Save the file and exit the text editor.

Restart the vsftpd service:

Restart the vsftpd service for the changes to take effect:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Now, your users should be able to access their new home directories and have full permissions to create, modify, and delete files and directories within those directories. If you still encounter issues, double-check the user permissions and vsftpd configuration.




User
If I have four ftp users: `rebecca`, `asing`, `oliver`, and `thomas`, and their new home directories are: `/mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca`, `/mnt/zfs/ftpusers/asing`, `/mnt/zfs/ftpusers/oliver`, and `/mnt/zfs/ftpusers/thomas` respectively,  then the `local_root`setting in /etc/vsftpd.conf would be:

`local_root=/mnt/zfs/ftpusers/$USER`

Is it correct?

ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct! In the /etc/vsftpd.conf file, you can use the $USER variable to represent the individual username. So, the local_root setting should be:

ruby
Copy code
local_root=/mnt/zfs/ftpusers/$USER
This setting will assign the appropriate home directory for each user based on their username when they log in. Remember to restart the vsftpd service after modifying the configuration file:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd

ChatGPT
It looks like the server is asking for a client certificate, which may be related to the SSL/TLS configuration. To disable the client certificate requirement, edit the /etc/vsftpd.conf file and make sure that the following lines are set:

makefile
Copy code
ssl_enable=YES
allow_anon_ssl=NO
force_local_data_ssl=YES
force_local_logins_ssl=YES
ssl_tlsv1=YES
ssl_sslv2=NO
ssl_sslv3=NO
require_ssl_reuse=NO
ssl_ciphers=HIGH
Make sure there's no require_cert or validate_cert option enabled.

Additionally, ensure that the correct certificate and key files are specified in the configuration:

typescript
Copy code
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
These are the default self-signed certificates created by the ssl-cert package. If you're using custom certificates, make sure to point to the correct paths.

Save the changes and restart the vsftpd service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
After making these changes, try to connect again using the FTP client. If the issue persists, check the FTP client settings and ensure that it's configured to use TLS/SSL and not trying to authenticate with a client certificate.




User
In the configuration file, there are two lines:
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem

And the actual files are:
alex@srv:/mnt/zfs$ sudo ls -all /etc/ssl/private/

drwx--x--- 2 root ssl-cert 4096  4月 19 17:57 .

-rw-r----- 1 root ssl-cert 1704  8月 24  2022 ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
-rw-r----- 1 root root     1704  4月 18 22:45 vsftpd.key
-rw------- 1 root root     3010  4月 19 17:58 vsftpd.pem

Are the settings correct?

ChatGPT
Yes, your settings seem to be correct. The rsa_cert_file and rsa_private_key_file options are pointing to the appropriate certificate and key files (vsftpd.pem and vsftpd.key). However, I see that both the certificate and the key are in the same file (vsftpd.pem). While this can work, it's generally a better practice to have separate files for the certificate and the key.

In your case, since you have a separate key file (vsftpd.key), you can update the rsa_private_key_file option to point to this file:

typescript
Copy code
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key
Make sure the permissions for the key file (vsftpd.key) are set correctly:

bash
Copy code
sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key
sudo chown root:root /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key
After making these changes, restart the vsftpd service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Now, try connecting with the FTP client again. If you still face issues, double-check the FTP client settings and ensure it's configured to use TLS/SSL and not trying to authenticate with a client certificate.




User
I noticed that the vsftpd.key and vsftpd.pem are with different date-time.  One is April 18, the other April 19.  Would it be an issue?

-rw------- 1 root root     3010  4月 19 17:58 vsftpd.pem

ChatGPT
The different date-times for vsftpd.key and vsftpd.pem indicate that they were generated or modified at different times. It is important to make sure that the key and certificate files are a matching pair, meaning the key is the private key for the certificate in the vsftpd.pem file.

If you're unsure whether they match or not, you can generate a new self-signed certificate and private key using OpenSSL:

bash
Copy code
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key -out /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem
This command will generate a new private key (vsftpd.key) and a self-signed certificate (vsftpd.pem) that are a matching pair. It will prompt you for some information, like country, state, organization, etc. You can fill in these details or press enter to accept the default values.

After generating the new key and certificate, make sure to update the vsftpd configuration file as mentioned in the previous response:

typescript
Copy code
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.key
Then, restart the vsftpd service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
Now, try connecting with the FTP client again.

ChatGPT
Based on the log entries, it seems that the client is successfully connecting and authenticating with the server. There are no errors or issues apparent in these logs, which suggests that the problem might lie elsewhere.

You may want to check the FTP client configuration and make sure it is set to use the correct encryption settings (e.g., "Require explicit FTP over TLS" in FileZilla) and the correct port (usually 21 for vsftpd with explicit FTP over TLS). Additionally, ensure that the client is using passive mode for data transfers, as active mode can cause issues when firewalls or NAT devices are in place.

If you are still experiencing issues, try checking the logs on the FTP client-side for any errors or issues. You may also want to test the connection with a different FTP client to see if the issue persists.

If the issue still remains unresolved, please provide more information about the error messages you are receiving on the client-side or any other relevant logs.




User
Now the client (WinSCP, FileZilla) is connecting to my vsftpd with no error.

ChatGPT
I'm glad to hear that the issue has been resolved and you can now connect to your vsftpd server using WinSCP and FileZilla without any errors. It seems that the previous suggestions and configuration changes helped to address the problem.

If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.




User
Houston, I still have problem.
When the client starts transfer larger files to the remote site, it always got timeout and the file would be truncated.  How could I resolve this issue?

ChatGPT
I'm sorry to hear that you're still experiencing issues with file transfers. Let's try adjusting some settings to help resolve the timeout issue when transferring larger files.

Increase the timeout settings in vsftpd configuration file:
Edit the /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf file and add or modify the following settings:

makefile
Copy code
connect_timeout=120
data_connection_timeout=300
idle_session_timeout=600
These settings will increase the connection timeout, data connection timeout, and idle session timeout, respectively.

Increase the timeout settings in your FTP client:
For FileZilla:

Open FileZilla and go to Edit > Settings.
Navigate to Connection > Timeout.
Increase the "Timeout in seconds" value (e.g., to 120 seconds or higher).
For WinSCP:

Open WinSCP and navigate to the stored session for your server.
Click Edit > Advanced > Connection.
Increase the "Server response timeout" value (e.g., to 120 seconds or higher).
Disable passive mode in vsftpd configuration file (if you're using active mode):
Edit the /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf file and set the following:

makefile
Copy code
pasv_enable=NO
If you use passive mode, make sure your passive port range is open in your firewall.

Restart the vsftpd service:
After making changes to the configuration file, restart the vsftpd service to apply the new settings:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
After adjusting these settings, try transferring larger files again and see if the issue has been resolved.




User
Do you know how to select multiple files in FileZilla?

ChatGPT
Yes, selecting multiple files in FileZilla is quite simple. Here's how to do it:

Click on a file or folder in the file list to select it.

To select multiple files or folders:

Hold the Ctrl key (or Cmd key on macOS) and click on each file or folder you want to select. This will allow you to select multiple individual items.
Hold the Shift key and click on the first and last file or folder in a continuous range. This will select all files and folders between the two items, including the first and last ones you clicked on.
Once you've selected the files or folders, you can perform various actions, such as dragging them to another directory, right-clicking to open a context menu with additional options, or using the buttons in the toolbar to transfer the files.

Remember that the same selection methods apply to both the local (your computer) and remote (server) file lists in FileZilla.




User
Is there any setting for showing a progress window while files transferring in FileZilla?

ChatGPT
FileZilla does not have a separate progress window, but it does show the progress of file transfers within the main interface. When you transfer files using FileZilla, you can monitor the progress in the "Queued files" tab at the bottom of the application window.

The "Queued files" tab displays a list of files currently being transferred or waiting to be transferred. It shows the source and target directories, the file size, and the progress of each file transfer as a percentage. Additionally, a progress bar visually represents the progress of each transfer.

There is no separate progress window, but this built-in feature should provide you with enough information about the status of your file transfers.




User
> Edit the /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf file and add or modify the following settings:

My configuration file is located in /etc/, not /etc/vsftpd/.  Does it matter?

ChatGPT
It does not matter as long as you are editing the correct configuration file for your vsftpd installation. The default location for the configuration file on some systems is /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf, while on other systems, it might be located directly in the /etc/ directory.

As long as you're confident that you're editing the correct configuration file for your vsftpd installation, the specific location should not be an issue. Just make sure to restart the vsftpd service after making changes to the configuration file for the changes to take effect:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
or

bash
Copy code
sudo service vsftpd restart



User
After adusting timeout settings in vsftpd.conf, and setting timeout to 300 seconds in FileZilla, there is still timeout issue during file transfer.  The file being transferred is 1,946,009,588 in size.

From the log file, it appears that there is an issue with the SSL connection during the data transfer. The line below shows that the data connection is terminated without SSL shutdown:

arduino
Copy code
Thu Apr 20 02:56:12 2023 [pid 241828] [rebecca] DEBUG: Client "1.34.184.226", "DATA connection terminated without SSL shutdown. Buggy client! Integrity of upload cannot be asserted."
This indicates that there might be an issue with the client (FileZilla) or its configuration. Here are a few suggestions to try:

Update FileZilla to the latest version if you haven't done so already.

Double-check your FileZilla settings related to SSL/TLS. Go to Edit > Settings > Connection > FTP > FTP over TLS settings and ensure that:

"Require explicit FTP over TLS" is selected.
"Disallow plain unencrypted FTP" is checked.
If the problem persists, try disabling the TLS session resumption in vsftpd by adding the following line to your vsftpd.conf file:

makefile
Copy code
ssl_disable_session_reuse=YES
After adding this line, restart the vsftpd service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
or

Copy code
sudo service vsftpd restart
If none of the above solutions work, consider trying a different FTP client to see if the issue is specific to FileZilla or a more general issue with your FTP server configuration.

Keep in mind that troubleshooting SSL/TLS issues can be complex, and it might take some time and experimentation to identify the root cause.




User
I have followed your instructions and tried FileZilla, WinSCP in different client machines.  The issue persists.

ChatGPT
Since the issue persists across different clients and machines, it is more likely to be an issue with the server configuration or the network environment. Here are some steps to help you diagnose and resolve the problem:

Check for any firewalls, security groups, or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) on your server or network that could be interfering with the data transfer. Make sure that the required ports for passive mode (in your case, ports 40000-50000) are open and not being blocked by any security measures.

Temporarily disable SSL/TLS encryption for file transfers to see if the issue is related to the encryption. You can do this by setting the following options in your vsftpd.conf file:

makefile
Copy code
ssl_enable=NO
force_local_data_ssl=NO
force_local_logins_ssl=NO
After making these changes, restart the vsftpd service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
or

Copy code
sudo service vsftpd restart
Try transferring a large file without encryption. If the transfer is successful, it confirms that the issue is related to SSL/TLS encryption.

If the issue is related to SSL/TLS, consider obtaining a new SSL certificate for your server. There could be a problem with your current certificate, such as being expired or using weak cryptographic algorithms.

If none of the above steps help, consider increasing the log verbosity for vsftpd to get more detailed logs about the issue. Add the following line to your vsftpd.conf file:

makefile
Copy code
log_ftp_protocol=YES
Restart the vsftpd service, and review the logs to gather more information about the cause of the timeout. This may help you pinpoint the issue or provide valuable information for further troubleshooting.

Remember that diagnosing and resolving network and encryption-related issues can be complex and time-consuming. It might require a deep investigation into server configurations, network settings, and security measures to identify and fix the problem.

If I give up the vsftpd, go to

ChatGPT
It seems your question was cut off. If you are considering using an alternative to vsftpd, there are several other FTP server options available. Here are a few popular ones you can try:

Pure-FTPd: Pure-FTPd is a secure and efficient FTP server with numerous features and a strong focus on security. It supports various authentication methods and provides built-in TLS support. You can find more information and installation instructions on their website: https://www.pureftpd.org/

ProFTPD: ProFTPD is a powerful and highly configurable FTP server that supports a wide range of features. It is easy to set up, can handle a large number of simultaneous connections, and offers extensive security options. Visit their website for more information and installation instructions: http://www.proftpd.org/

FileZilla Server: FileZilla Server is a free, open-source FTP server from the creators of the popular FileZilla Client. It is known for its user-friendly interface and supports FTP, FTPS, and SFTP protocols. Keep in mind that FileZilla Server is primarily available for Windows platforms. You can download FileZilla Server here: https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=server

Before switching to a different FTP server, consider your specific requirements and the features you need. Each server has its strengths and weaknesses, so choose the one that best suits your needs.

If you're open to using a different protocol altogether, consider using SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol), which is a secure and reliable file transfer protocol that comes built-in with most Linux distributions. You can use OpenSSH to set up an SFTP server:

Ensure that OpenSSH server is installed on your system:

sql
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
Edit the OpenSSH configuration file, typically located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config, and make sure the following line is present and not commented out:

bash
Copy code
Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
Restart the OpenSSH service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
Create a new user or use an existing user to access the SFTP server. If creating a new user, set a strong password and specify the user's home directory:

bash
Copy code
sudo useradd -m -d /path/to/your/directory newusername
sudo passwd newusername
Test the SFTP connection using an SFTP client, such as FileZilla, WinSCP, or the command line sftp utility.

SFTP offers encryption and better security out-of-the-box, making it a popular choice for file transfers.




User
Yes, my previous question was cut off.

What I would like to ask was:
Since vsftpd is so challenging for me, would it be easier (and securer) to use an SFTP server?

ChatGPT
Yes, using an SFTP server can be both easier and more secure than using an FTP server like vsftpd. SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a secure file transfer protocol that operates over an encrypted SSH connection. It provides better security by default and does not require additional configuration to enable encryption, unlike FTP servers.

One of the main advantages of SFTP is that it runs over the same port as SSH (port 22 by default), which simplifies firewall configuration and reduces the number of open ports on your server. Additionally, SFTP uses a single connection for both control and data, making it more efficient than FTP.

To set up an SFTP server, you can use OpenSSH, which is typically installed by default on most Linux distributions. Here's a quick guide on setting up an SFTP server with OpenSSH:

Ensure that OpenSSH server is installed on your system:

sql
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
Edit the OpenSSH configuration file, typically located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config, and make sure the following line is present and not commented out:

bash
Copy code
Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
Restart the OpenSSH service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
Create a new user or use an existing user to access the SFTP server. If creating a new user, set a strong password and specify the user's home directory:

bash
Copy code
sudo useradd -m -d /path/to/your/directory newusername
sudo passwd newusername
Test the SFTP connection using an SFTP client, such as FileZilla, WinSCP, or the command line sftp utility.

By using SFTP, you'll have a simpler and more secure file transfer solution compared to using an FTP server like vsftpd.




User
Now I would like to set up an SFTP server on my Ubuntu 22.04.  I have followed the steps you provided.  However, when the WinSCP client tries to connect the server, it got the following error:

No supported authentication methods available (server sent: publickey)

Authentication log (see session log for details):
Using username "rebecca".

Authentication failed.

How should I resolve this issue?

ChatGPT
The error message you're encountering indicates that the SFTP server is only accepting public key authentication, and not password authentication. You can either configure the server to allow password authentication or set up public key authentication for your client.

Option 1: Enable password authentication on the server

Edit the OpenSSH configuration file, typically located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Look for the following line:

perl
Copy code
PasswordAuthentication no
If it's set to "no," change it to "yes":

bash
Copy code
PasswordAuthentication yes
If the line is commented out (has a # in front of it), remove the # and set it to "yes."

Save the file and exit the editor (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

Restart the OpenSSH service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
Try connecting with WinSCP again using the password for the "rebecca" user.

Option 2: Set up public key authentication for the client

Generate a public/private key pair on the client machine using a tool like PuTTYgen (Windows) or the ssh-keygen command (Linux and macOS).

Copy the public key to the server. On Linux or macOS, you can use the ssh-copy-id command:

typescript
Copy code
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub rebecca@your_server_ip
On Windows, open the public key file with a text editor, copy its contents, and then paste it into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file in the "rebecca" user's home directory on the server. If the file does not exist, create it.

Ensure that the permissions of the ~/.ssh directory and the authorized_keys file are set correctly on the server:

bash
Copy code
chmod 700 /home/rebecca/.ssh
chmod 600 /home/rebecca/.ssh/authorized_keys
chown -R rebecca:rebecca /home/rebecca/.ssh
In WinSCP, configure the connection to use the private key file you generated in step 1. Go to "Advanced Site Settings," then "SSH" > "Authentication" and browse for your private key file.

Try connecting with WinSCP again.

Either of these options should resolve the authentication issue you're facing. If you prefer a more secure connection, go with Option 2 (public key authentication).




User
I used "Option 1: Enable password authentication on the server" and set "PasswordAuthentication yes" in /etc/ssh/sshd_config as you provided.

However, The Authentication failure persists.

Can we check any log file to trace the issue?

ChatGPT
Yes, you can check the server logs to get more information about the authentication failure. Here's how:

On the server, open the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file again:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Look for the following line:

Copy code
LogLevel INFO
If it's set to "INFO," change it to "VERBOSE":

Copy code
LogLevel VERBOSE
If the line is commented out (has a # in front of it), remove the # and set it to "VERBOSE."

Save the file and exit the editor (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

Restart the OpenSSH service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
Try connecting with WinSCP again and note the time of the failed connection attempt.

Check the SSH log on the server. By default, it is located in the /var/log/auth.log file. You can view the log using the tail command:

bash
Copy code
sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/auth.log
This command shows the last 50 lines of the log. Look for entries around the time of the failed connection attempt to get more information about the issue.

If you find any specific error messages or information in the logs, please provide them here so I can help you further troubleshoot the problem.

Based on the log entries, it seems that the issue is related to the ownership and permissions of the chroot directory:

bash
Copy code
Apr 21 00:35:48 srv sshd[292321]: fatal: bad ownership or modes for chroot directory component "/mnt/zfs/"
To resolve this, you need to ensure that the chroot directory has the correct ownership and permissions. The chroot directory should be owned by the root user and have permissions that don't grant write access to the group or others.

First, change the ownership of the chroot directory to root:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown root:root /mnt/zfs
Next, set the appropriate permissions:

bash
Copy code
sudo chmod 755 /mnt/zfs
Now, restart the OpenSSH service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
Finally, try connecting with WinSCP again. If the issue persists, please provide any new log entries related to the problem.

It seems that there is still an issue with the ownership or permissions of the chroot directory, which is preventing the user from logging in. To fix this, you should check and correct the ownership and permissions of the chroot directory and its components. Here's what you should do:

Verify the ownership and permissions of the chroot directory:
bash
Copy code
sudo ls -ld /mnt/zfs
The chroot directory should be owned by root and have permissions set to 755. If it is not, correct the ownership and permissions:
bash
Copy code
sudo chown root:root /mnt/zfs
sudo chmod 755 /mnt/zfs
Check and correct the ownership and permissions of the subdirectories and files inside the chroot directory. They should not be owned by root or writable by the root group or others.
bash
Copy code
sudo find /mnt/zfs -type d -exec chown rebecca:rebecca {} \;
sudo find /mnt/zfs -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
sudo find /mnt/zfs -type f -exec chown rebecca:rebecca {} \;
sudo find /mnt/zfs -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
Restart the SSH service:
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
Ask the user to try logging in again.
If the issue persists, please provide the updated log entries from /var/log/auth.log and the output of the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo ls -la /mnt/zfs



User
```
sudo find /mnt/zfs -type d -exec chown rebecca:rebecca {} \;
sudo find /mnt/zfs -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
sudo find /mnt/zfs -type f -exec chown rebecca:rebecca {} \;
sudo find /mnt/zfs -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```
Should I run all these four commands at one time, or run them separtely?

ChatGPT
You should run these commands one by one, not all at once. Running them one at a time ensures that each command is executed completely before moving on to the next one. Here's the sequence:

Run the first command to change the ownership of all directories inside the chroot directory to rebecca:rebecca:
bash
Copy code
sudo find /mnt/zfs -type d -exec chown rebecca:rebecca {} \;
Run the second command to change the permissions of all directories inside the chroot directory to 755:
bash
Copy code
sudo find /mnt/zfs -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
Run the third command to change the ownership of all files inside the chroot directory to rebecca:rebecca:
bash
Copy code
sudo find /mnt/zfs -type f -exec chown rebecca:rebecca {} \;
Run the fourth command to change the permissions of all files inside the chroot directory to 644:
bash
Copy code
sudo find /mnt/zfs -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
After running all four commands, restart the SSH service and ask the user to try logging in again. If the issue persists, provide the updated log entries from /var/log/auth.log and the output of the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo ls -la /mnt/zfs



User
Are there some misunderstandings between us?

I would like to make the home directory of "rebecca" be /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca, home directory of "oliver" be /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/oliver...... respectively.  However, the owner of other directories (including all subdirectories) should be alex, not rebecca.


ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. In that case, please follow these steps:

Set the home directory for the user "rebecca" to /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca and for "oliver" to /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/oliver:
bash
Copy code
sudo usermod -d /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca rebecca
sudo usermod -d /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/oliver oliver
Change the ownership of the user-specific directories:
bash
Copy code
sudo chown rebecca:rebecca /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca
sudo chown oliver:oliver /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/oliver
Set the correct permissions for these directories:
bash
Copy code
sudo chmod 755 /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca
sudo chmod 755 /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/oliver
Make sure that the owner of other directories (including all subdirectories) is alex:
bash
Copy code
sudo find /mnt/zfs -mindepth 1 -type d -not -path "/mnt/zfs/ftpusers/*" -exec chown alex:alex {} \;
This command will find all directories under /mnt/zfs excluding the /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/* path and change their ownership to alex:alex.

Restart the SSH service:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
After completing these steps, the users should be able to log in with their correct home directories. If any issues persist, please provide the updated log entries from /var/log/auth.log.

ChatGPT
The issue persists because the SSH configuration is set up to use chroot for user "rebecca," which restricts the user to their home directory. The error "bad ownership or modes for chroot directory component" indicates that the ownership or permissions for the chroot directory do not meet the requirements for a chroot jail.

In this case, the chroot directory component "/mnt/zfs/" has incorrect ownership. To resolve this issue, change the ownership of the "/mnt/zfs/" directory to "root:root":

bash
Copy code
sudo chown root:root /mnt/zfs
After changing the ownership, restart the SSH service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
Now, try logging in again as "rebecca." If the issue persists, please provide the updated log entries from /var/log/auth.log.

It seems there is an issue with the ownership or permissions of the chroot directory component "/mnt/zfs/ftpusers/". The log shows that the user "rebecca" has tried to connect multiple times, but each connection attempt has failed due to this issue.

To fix the problem, you should adjust the permissions and ownership of the "/mnt/zfs/ftpusers/" directory. You can do this by running the following commands:

Change the ownership of the directory to the user "rebecca" and the group "sftpusers":
ruby
Copy code
alex@srv:~$ sudo chown rebecca:sftpusers /mnt/zfs/ftpusers
Set the permissions for the directory to ensure that only the owner has read, write, and execute permissions:
ruby
Copy code
alex@srv:~$ sudo chmod 700 /mnt/zfs/ftpusers
After running these commands, the issue with the chroot directory should be resolved, and the user "rebecca" should be able to connect successfully.




User
Did you forget that there are other users' home directories under `ftpusers`?  The strcuture is as follows:
home directory for oliver: /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/oliver
home directory for rebecca: /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca
home directory for asing: /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/asing
home directory for thomas: /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/thomas
......
home directory for xxx: /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/xxx

Therefore, it seems not feasible to set the owner of /mnt/zfs/ftpusers to rebecca.

By the way, I can rearrange the home directories for each SFTP users if needed.


ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. Given that there are multiple users with their own home directories under /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/, you should instead ensure that the /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/ directory itself has the correct permissions and ownership.

First, change the ownership of the /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/ directory to root. This will ensure that only the root user has control over the parent directory.

ruby
Copy code
alex@srv:~$ sudo chown root:root /mnt/zfs/ftpusers
Next, set the permissions for the /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/ directory to 755 to ensure that only the owner (root) can modify the directory, while others can access and read its contents.

ruby
Copy code
alex@srv:~$ sudo chmod 755 /mnt/zfs/ftpusers
Now, for each user's home directory, you should set the ownership to the respective user and the group to sftpusers. Also, set the permissions to 700 to ensure that only the owner has read, write, and execute permissions.

For example, for the user "rebecca":

ruby
Copy code
alex@srv:~$ sudo chown rebecca:sftpusers /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca
alex@srv:~$ sudo chmod 700 /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca
Repeat the above commands for all other users, replacing "rebecca" with the respective username.

This setup should resolve the issue with the chroot directory and allow each user to connect successfully.




User
> First, change the ownership of the /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/ directory to root.

Is it possible to change the ownership of /mnt/zfs/ftpusers directory to alex? I have this question because alex is the administrator.

ChatGPT
Yes, you can change the ownership of the /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/ directory to the user "alex" if you prefer. To do so, run the following command:

ruby
Copy code
alex@srv:~$ sudo chown alex:root /mnt/zfs/ftpusers
This command sets the owner of the /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/ directory to "alex" and the group to "root".

After changing the ownership, ensure that you have set the permissions for the /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/ directory to 755:

ruby
Copy code
alex@srv:~$ sudo chmod 755 /mnt/zfs/ftpusers
With these changes, "alex" will have full control over the /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/ directory, and other users will be able to access and read its contents but not modify it.

Remember to set the ownership and permissions for each user's home directory as previously described to ensure a secure setup.

The settings you've shared look good with the following observations:

The /mnt/zfs/ftpusers directory is owned by "alex" and the group is set to "root". The permissions are set correctly to 755, which allows the owner to have full control and others to have read and execute permissions.

The individual user directories within /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/ are owned by their respective users, and permissions seem appropriate, allowing each user full control over their own directory.

These settings should work for your SFTP setup.

I apologize for the oversight. It appears that the ownership of the /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/ directory is still causing issues. To resolve this issue, you can change the ownership of the /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/ directory to "root" instead of "alex":

bash
Copy code
sudo chown root:root /mnt/zfs/ftpusers
After changing the ownership, the issue should be resolved. Please try connecting again as the "rebecca" user and let me know if the problem persists.

It appears that the issue is related to the ownership or permissions of the chroot directory "/mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca". The SSH daemon is complaining about the ownership or permissions of that directory.

To resolve this issue, please adjust the ownership and permissions for the chroot directory as follows:

Change the ownership of the directory to the user "rebecca" and the group "rebecca":
bash
Copy code
sudo chown rebecca:rebecca /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca
Set the correct permissions for the directory:
bash
Copy code
sudo chmod 755 /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca
After making these changes, please try to log in again as user "rebecca". If it still does not work, let me know, and we can continue troubleshooting.




User
But the ownership of /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca is already rebecca.  I think the permissions for the directory are also correct.  Please verify:

You are right, the ownership and permissions for the "/mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca" directory appear to be correct. However, when using chroot, SSH also requires the parent directories to have correct permissions. In this case, the parent directory is "/mnt/zfs/ftpusers". Let's ensure that the parent directory permissions are correct:

Change the ownership of the parent directory to "root" user and "root" group:
bash
Copy code
sudo chown root:root /mnt/zfs/ftpusers
Set the correct permissions for the parent directory:
bash
Copy code
sudo chmod 755 /mnt/zfs/ftpusers
After making these changes, please try to log in again as user "rebecca". If it still does not work, let me know, and we can continue troubleshooting.

The parent directory, /mnt/zfs/ftpusers, seems correctly set.  Please verify:

There is one thing I forgot to mention: the /mnt/zfs directory is actually another hard drive rather than the /home directory.  Does it matter?

ChatGPT
The fact that /mnt/zfs is a separate hard drive shouldn't be an issue as long as the file system supports POSIX permissions and ownership. However, I noticed that you're using a ZFS file system. ZFS has its own Access Control Lists (ACLs) that might be affecting the chroot permissions.

Let's check the ACLs for the /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca directory:

bash
Copy code
sudo getfacl /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca
If the output shows any permissions or ownership issues, we can modify the ACLs accordingly.

To modify the ACLs for the /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca directory, you can use the setfacl command:

bash
Copy code
sudo setfacl -m u:rebecca:rwx /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca
sudo setfacl -m g::r-x /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca
sudo setfacl -m o::r-x /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca
This sets the correct permissions for the user "rebecca" and also makes sure that the group and other users have only read and execute permissions.

After modifying the ACLs, try logging in again as user "rebecca". If it still doesn't work, let me know, and we can continue troubleshooting.




User
alex@srv:/mnt/zfs$ sudo getfacl /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca
getfacl: 從絕對路徑名尾部去除“/”字符
# file: mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca
# owner: rebecca
# group: rebecca
user::rwx
group::r-x
other::r-x

ChatGPT
The output of getfacl shows that the Access Control Lists (ACLs) are already set correctly for the /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca directory. The user "rebecca" has read, write, and execute permissions, while the group and others have read and execute permissions.

Since the directory permissions and ownership seem correct, let's check the vsftpd configuration again to ensure the correct settings are in place.

Please provide the content of your vsftpd configuration file by running:

bash
Copy code
cat /etc/vsftpd.conf
Additionally, if you made any changes to the PAM configuration for vsftpd, please provide the content of that file as well by running:

bash
Copy code
cat /etc/pam.d/vsftpd
We can review these files and see if there is any misconfiguration causing the issue.




User
vsftpd?  What we are working on is SFTP. Why check vsftpd?

ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. I misunderstood the context. Since we are working on SFTP, there is no need to check the vsftpd configuration.

Given that the permissions, ownership, and ACLs all seem to be set correctly, the issue could be related to the SSH server configuration. Please provide the content of your sshd_config file by running:

bash
Copy code
sudo cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
We can review this file to see if there is any misconfiguration causing the issue.

Thank you for providing the sshd_config file. I see that you have configured a Match block for the users, which is good. However, there is a potential issue with the chroot directory.

In the Match block for users, you have:

perl
Copy code
ChrootDirectory %h
This configuration line will chroot the users to their home directories. However, for chroot to work correctly, the chroot directory and all its parent directories must be owned by root and not writable by any other user or group. In your current setup, the /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca directory is owned by rebecca, and /mnt/zfs/ftpusers is owned by root. This is likely the cause of the problem.

A solution to this issue is to create a separate directory for each user within their home directory and chroot them to their home directory. You should change the ownership of the home directory to root, then create a subdirectory (e.g., files) owned by the user. Here's how to do that for user rebecca:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown root:root /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca
sudo mkdir /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca/files
sudo chown rebecca:rebecca /mnt/zfs/ftpusers/rebecca/files
Do this for the other users as well. After making these changes, the users will be chrooted to their home directories but will only have write access to their files subdirectory. You can adjust the paths accordingly if you want to use different directory names.

Once you've made these changes, restart the SSH server to apply the new configuration:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
Now, the users should be able to connect via SFTP and write to their files directory.




User
Now the users is able to connect via SFTP and write to their files directory.

However, a transfer issue keeps occurring.  When a file is being uploaded, there is:
 Network error: Software caused connection abort
every a few seconds.

The error message "Network error: Software caused connection abort" indicates that there is a problem with the connection between the client and the server. This issue might be caused by network issues, an unstable client, or a misconfiguration on the server-side. It seems like the user "rebecca" is able to connect, but the connection is being dropped after a few seconds.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:

Check the network connection between the client and the server. Test the connection with tools like ping, traceroute, or mtr to see if there are any packet loss or high latency issues.

Examine the logs on both the client and server side to get more information about the issue. On the server side, you can check /var/log/auth.log (as you have done) and /var/log/syslog. On the client side, you can enable debug logging in the SFTP client to get more detailed information about the issue.

Make sure the client software is up to date and try using a different SFTP client to see if the issue persists.

Check the server resources like CPU, memory, and disk space usage. A high load on the server or a lack of resources could cause the connection to be dropped.

Check the configuration in /etc/ssh/sshd_config. One possible cause of the issue might be related to the ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax settings. These settings control how often the server sends keep-alive messages to the client and how many keep-alive messages can be lost before the server closes the connection. You can try increasing these values to see if it helps with the issue:

Copy code
ClientAliveInterval 60
ClientAliveCountMax 5
If none of the above steps help, consider checking for any security tools or firewalls that may be interfering with the connection.

Remember to restart the SSH service after making any changes to the configuration file:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
After trying these troubleshooting steps, if the issue persists, you might want to consider reaching out to the client's support team or community for further assistance.

Can the command:
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_sack=0
resolve the network error during file tranfer?


ChatGPT
Disabling TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) by setting net.ipv4.tcp_sack=0 can potentially help resolve certain network issues during file transfers, but it's not guaranteed.

TCP SACK is an optimization that improves the performance of TCP connections in situations where there is packet loss or reordering. In some cases, however, it can cause issues with specific network devices, firewalls, or routers, and disabling it may help mitigate these issues.

If you suspect that TCP SACK is causing the network error during file transfer, you can disable it temporarily using the command you mentioned:

Copy code
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_sack=0
If disabling TCP SACK resolves the issue, you can make the change permanent by adding the following line to the /etc/sysctl.conf file:

Copy code
net.ipv4.tcp_sack = 0
Then, apply the changes using:

css
Copy code
sudo sysctl -p
However, keep in mind that disabling TCP SACK can negatively affect the performance of TCP connections in certain situations. It's essential to monitor the network performance and only disable TCP SACK if it's confirmed to be causing the issue. Otherwise, it's best to investigate other potential causes of the network error during file transfers, as suggested in the previous response.




User
After running the `sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_sack=0` command, should I restart SFTP server? Or restarting SFTP server would overwrite the `sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_sack=0` command?

ChatGPT
Running sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_sack=0 applies the change immediately to the running system without the need to restart any services, including the SFTP server. The change will affect new TCP connections established after the command has been executed.

Restarting the SFTP server will not overwrite the changes made by the sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_sack=0 command. The changes will persist until the system is rebooted or you manually set the value back to 1.

However, note that this change is temporary and will not persist across system reboots. If you want to make the change permanent, follow the instructions in the previous response to add the configuration to the /etc/sysctl.conf file and apply the changes using sudo sysctl -p. In this case, the change will persist across reboots, and you won't need to reapply the configuration after restarting the SFTP server or rebooting the system.




User
Does setting `ServerAliveInterval` and `ServerAliveCountMax` to a longer time in sshd_config help?

ChatGPT
Setting ServerAliveInterval and ServerAliveCountMax in the sshd_config file will not help because these options are client-side configurations, not server-side. They should be set in the client's SSH configuration file (usually ~/.ssh/config or /etc/ssh/ssh_config) to help maintain the connection and avoid disconnections due to inactivity or network issues.

ServerAliveInterval sets the interval, in seconds, for sending keepalive messages to the server to ensure that the connection remains active. ServerAliveCountMax sets the maximum number of keepalive messages that can be sent without receiving any response from the server. If the client doesn't receive a response after sending keepalive messages ServerAliveCountMax times, the connection will be terminated.

For example, you can add the following configuration to the client's SSH configuration file:

Copy code
Host *
  ServerAliveInterval 60
  ServerAliveCountMax 5
This configuration will send a keepalive message every 60 seconds, and if there is no response from the server after 5 consecutive messages, the client will terminate the connection. Adjust these values as needed based on your specific requirements and network conditions.

Remember that these settings should be added to the client-side configuration file, not the server's sshd_config file.




User
Will I get more information if I set the log level to (?) in sshd_config?

ChatGPT
Yes, you can get more information about the SSH activity by adjusting the log level in the sshd_config file. To do this, find the LogLevel directive in the sshd_config file (usually located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config), and set it to one of the following options:

QUIET: This level logs only very severe and critical messages.
FATAL: This level logs only fatal error messages.
ERROR: This level logs error messages. (default)
INFO: This level logs informational messages, including login/logout events. (recommended)
VERBOSE: This level logs additional information, such as connection and authentication details.
DEBUG: This level logs debugging information, including both server and client side events. It can generate a large amount of output and should only be used when trying to diagnose issues.
DEBUG1, DEBUG2, DEBUG3: These levels provide increasingly verbose debug information.
To change the log level, modify the LogLevel directive in the sshd_config file:

Copy code
LogLevel VERBOSE
After making changes to the sshd_config file, you need to restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect. On most systems, you can do this with one of the following commands:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
or

Copy code
sudo service ssh restart
Keep in mind that increasing the log level can generate a large amount of log output, which may affect system performance and storage. It's recommended to set the log level back to a lower setting, such as INFO, after diagnosing the issue.




User
I would like to change the LogLevel to DEBUG to see if there are clues for the network issue during file transfer.   Do you think this is helpful?

ChatGPT
Changing the LogLevel to DEBUG can indeed be helpful in diagnosing network issues during file transfers, as it provides very detailed logging information about the SSH/SFTP server's operations. However, keep in mind that setting the log level to DEBUG will generate a significant amount of log output, which may impact system performance and storage. It is generally recommended to use this log level only when actively diagnosing issues.

To change the log level to DEBUG, modify the LogLevel directive in the sshd_config file (usually located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config):

Copy code
LogLevel DEBUG
After making the change, restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
or

Copy code
sudo service ssh restart
Once you have collected the necessary log data for troubleshooting, remember to set the log level back to a lower setting, such as INFO, to minimize the impact on system performance and storage.

Would you mind helping me troubleshoot the file transfer issue from the log file?

ChatGPT
It appears that there are several SSH connections taking place. One is from IP 1.34.184.226 (port 57878) with the user "rebecca" using the WinSCP software. This user is authenticated, and their session is opened.

There are two more connections from IPs 128.199.22.26 (port 38898) and 139.59.14.93 (port 56028), both using the Go software. The log does not show the authentication status for these connections, as the log is cut off after the key exchange process.

There are no clear signs of malicious activity, but it's important to monitor these connections and ensure that the users connecting to the server are authorized. If you are unsure about the legitimacy of these connections, consider investigating further and potentially blocking the IP addresses if necessary.

> There are two more connections from IPs 128.199.22.26 (port 38898) and 139.59.14.93 (port 56028), both using the Go software.

I don't think these connections are authorized.  The users might be hackers.  How can I prevent and block these activities?

ChatGPT
If you suspect unauthorized connections and potential hacking attempts, it's essential to take appropriate steps to secure your system. Here are some recommendations to block and prevent these activities:

Block the suspicious IP addresses:
You can block the specific IP addresses using a firewall. Here's an example of how to block the IPs using the iptables command on Linux systems:

css
Copy code
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 128.199.22.26 -j DROP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 139.59.14.93 -j DROP
Make sure to replace the IP addresses with the ones you want to block. If you are using a different operating system or firewall, consult the appropriate documentation for blocking IP addresses.

Update your software:
Ensure all your system software, including the operating system, is up to date with the latest security patches. This will minimize the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited.

Strengthen authentication:
Use strong and unique passwords for all your accounts. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible to add an extra layer of security.

Limit user access:
Restrict user access to only the necessary areas of your system. Implement the principle of least privilege, which means granting users only the permissions they need to perform their tasks.

Monitor your network:
Regularly monitor your network for any unusual activities or connections. Set up intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to help detect and block unauthorized access attempts.

Harden your system:
Follow best practices for securing your system, such as disabling unnecessary services, closing unused ports, and implementing security policies.

Educate users:
Train users about the importance of cybersecurity and educate them about potential risks and how to identify and report suspicious activities.

Implement a backup and recovery plan:
Regularly back up your data and ensure you have a recovery plan in place in case of a security breach or data loss.

By following these steps, you can minimize the risk of unauthorized connections and potential hacking attempts. It is essential to maintain a proactive approach to cybersecurity to protect your system and data effectively.

My Client(WinSCP and FileZilla) machines and the SFTP server are actually located within the same LAN.  However the clients use a public ip(1.34.184.226) to connect to the server.

Would it be the possible cause regarding the connection abort / reconnect issue during file transfer?

ChatGPT
Yes, using a public IP address to connect to an SFTP server within the same LAN could potentially cause issues, including connection aborts or reconnects during file transfers. This is because the traffic has to go through additional hops (e.g., routers and switches) and might pass through your ISP's infrastructure or even be affected by NAT (Network Address Translation) when connecting via a public IP.

Using the local IP address of the server within the LAN can provide more reliable connections and faster transfer speeds. To resolve the issue, follow these steps:

Identify the local IP address of the SFTP server. On a Linux system, you can use the ifconfig command, while on a Windows system, you can use the ipconfig command.

Configure your SFTP clients (WinSCP and FileZilla) to use the local IP address of the server instead of the public IP. Update the host field in the connection settings with the local IP address.

Test the connection and file transfers. They should be more reliable and faster since the traffic is now confined within the LAN.

If you still experience connection issues after switching to the local IP address, consider looking into other factors like network congestion, hardware issues (e.g., faulty switches or cables), or server-side issues such as resource limitations or software problems.




User
Using server's internal ip(192.168.....), the clients within the same LAN can easily connect to my SFTP server and transfer large files without any problem.

In the meantime, I have also done some experiments regarding this issue and got some findings.  I would share them and discuss with you later.

ChatGPT
That's great to hear that using the server's internal IP address has resolved the issue for clients within the same LAN. It confirms that using the public IP was causing the connection aborts and reconnects during file transfers.

I'm glad that your setup is working smoothly now, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your findings and discussing them further. If you have any questions or need assistance with any aspect of your SFTP server, please feel free to ask.




User
My small experiment:

Fact: Clients and the SFTP server are located within the same LAN.  SFTP server is always wired.

Test cases:
1. Clients are wired:
    * Clients use server's private ip(192.168...) to connect to the SFTP server: successfully connected.  No any problem during files transfer.
    * Clients use public ip(1.34.184...) to connect to the SFTP server: successfully connected, but disconnects and reconnects every few seconds during files transfer.
2. Clients connect to WiFi:
    * Clients use ISP's ADSL + wireless router: Can use both private and public ip's to connect the SFTP server.  No any problem during files transfer.
    * Clients use my cell phone's hotspot share:
        * Connect SFTP server with privete ip: No any problem during files transfer.
        * Connect SFTP server with public ip: Successfully connected, but disconnects and reconnects every few seconds during files transfer.

Would you mind illustrating the above findings?

ChatGPT
Based on your experiments, it seems that the issue with disconnections and reconnects during file transfers is primarily caused when clients within the same LAN use the public IP to connect to the SFTP server. Here's a brief explanation of your findings:

Clients are wired:

Using the private IP (192.168...) provides a stable connection and smooth file transfers because both the clients and the server are within the same LAN. The traffic stays within the LAN without passing through the ISP's network or other external devices.
Using the public IP (1.34.184...) causes disconnections and reconnects during file transfers. This is because the traffic is routed through the ISP's network and other external devices before reaching the SFTP server, even though they are located within the same LAN. This additional routing can introduce latency and cause unstable connections.
Clients connect to WiFi:

Using the ISP's ADSL + wireless router: When using both private and public IPs to connect, there are no issues during file transfers. This indicates that the ISP's ADSL + wireless router is better at handling the additional routing caused by using the public IP.
Using your cell phone's hotspot share:
Using the private IP (192.168...) for the connection results in no problems during file transfers, as the traffic stays within the local network.
Using the public IP (1.34.184...) for the connection causes disconnections and reconnects during file transfers, similar to the wired scenario. The cell phone's hotspot might not handle the additional routing as efficiently as the ISP's ADSL + wireless router, causing unstable connections.
In summary, when clients and the SFTP server are in the same LAN, using the private IP provides the most stable connection and best performance for file transfers. Using the public IP introduces additional routing through external networks and devices, which can lead to disconnections and reconnects during file transfers. This issue seems to be more pronounced when using a wired connection or a cell phone hotspot, while the ISP's ADSL + wireless router appears to handle the additional routing more efficiently.




User
I would suggest that you take this into consideration in future discussions.  I think people would not be aware of this issue at first time.  You might remind them earlier.

ChatGPT
Thank you for your valuable feedback. I will definitely take this into consideration for future discussions and try to mention these potential issues earlier when users are experiencing similar problems. I appreciate your help in improving the quality of the assistance provided. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask.




User
Yes, I have another question.
Being the administrator of my Ubuntu 22.04, I would like to have full permissions to all directories when connecting my SFTP server.  How should I adjust the settings?

My account is `alex`.

ChatGPT
To give your user account 'alex' full permissions to all directories when connecting to your SFTP server, you can follow these steps:

First, make sure you have sudo privileges. If you are the administrator, you should already have this.

Edit the sshd_config file to adjust the SFTP settings:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Locate the Subsystem sftp line in the file. If it doesn't exist, you can add it at the end
of the file. Modify it to use the internal-sftp option and define the starting directory as the root directory /. The line should look like this:

csharp
Copy code
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp -d /
To restrict the SFTP access to only your user, add the following block at the end of the file:

sql
Copy code
Match User alex
    ForceCommand internal-sftp -d /
    ChrootDirectory none
    AllowTcpForwarding no
    X11Forwarding no
This will match the user 'alex' and apply the specified options. The ChrootDirectory none ensures you have access to the entire file system.

Save the changes and exit the editor by pressing Ctrl + X, followed by Y, and then Enter.

Restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart ssh
Now, when you connect to your SFTP server using the 'alex' account, you should have full permissions to access all directories on the system. However, please note that giving full access to an SFTP user is a potential security risk. Only do this if you are confident in your security setup and understand the potential consequences.




User
I think there is another issue that has to be handled first.

I got the following error when running `git pull` and `git commit` commmands.  The error did not occur before setting SFTP server.

alex@srv:/mnt/zfs/Python/small_projects$ git commit -m "minors"
fatal: could not open '.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG': Permission denied

alex@srv:/mnt/zfs/Python/small_projects$ git commit -m "minors"
fatal: could not open '.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG': Permission denied

ChatGPT
It seems like the permissions on the .git directory or its contents might have been changed, possibly during the SFTP setup. To resolve this issue, you can try resetting the permissions and ownership for the entire repository directory.

Navigate to the parent directory of your Git repository:

bash
Copy code
cd /mnt/zfs/Python
Change the ownership of the entire small_projects directory to your user 'alex' and the group you belong to. You can use the chown command with the -R flag for recursive ownership change:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown -R alex:<your_group> small_projects
Replace <your_group> with the appropriate group name, which is often the same as your username.

Set the appropriate permissions for the entire small_projects directory. Usually, 755 for directories and 644 for files should work:

bash
Copy code
sudo find small_projects -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
sudo find small_projects -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
If you have any scripts that need to be executable, you may need to set the executable permission for those files explicitly:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x path/to/your/script.sh
Now, try running the git pull and git commit commands again. The permission issue should be resolved.




User
The `git pull` and `git commit` commands are running properly after adjusting files / directories ownership and permissions as you suggested.

Thank you for helping me, Chat.

ChatGPT
You're welcome! I'm glad the issue is resolved, and the git pull and git commit commands are working properly now. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. I'm here to help!
